        <b>Instructor:</b> Mr. Gian Alix <br>
        <b>Email:</b> <a href="mailto: galix@olympiadsmail.ca">galix@olympiadsmail.ca</a> <br>
        <b>Class Times: </b> Saturdays, 4:40 - 6:40 PM <br>
        <b>Location: </b> Unit 336, Room 04 <br>
        <b>Term Duration: </b> This course will run weekly for <i>sixteen weeks</i>, starting from September 10th, 2024 to January 12th, 2025. <br>
        <hr>
        
        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>This course is mainly designed for students who intend on participating in computing contests, such as University of Waterloo's <a href="https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/ccc" target="_blank">Canadian Computing Competition (CCC)</a>. The contents of this course will help aid the students prepare for the upcoming contests. The first half of the course is mostly a review of the topics covered in the Introduction to Programming courses (e.g., branching statements, loops, recursion, simple linear data structures like arrays and lists, etc.); contest-like problems that utilize these topics are also covered. The second half of this course focuses on more advanced topics of computing that also come up in programming contests, such as stacks, queues, trees, and simple sorting algorithms. Overall, while the course is geared towards students who intend on joining computing contests, it is also open to anyone with basic programming background who intends on expanding programming knowledge, improving problem-solving skills, and/or solving programming challenges. Students who complete this course will gain eligibility to take on the second level of the CCC course. </p>
        <p><b>Course Prerequisites: </b> Introduction to Programming (either in Python, Java, or C++) </p>
        <p class="alert"><i><b>Note: </b> Please contact your instructor if you have not completed the prerequisites for this course.</i> </p>

        <h3>Course Policies</h3>
        <ol style="line-height:1.5;">
            <li>Please come on time (~10-15 minutes before the start of the class time).</li>
            <li>Have your laptop computer ready fully-charged (or at least with battery); if your laptop is close to 0%, make sure to bring a charger to class (always bring a charger!).  <span class="alert">Note that a tablet or a phone cannot be used as a replacement for a laptop.</span></li>
            <li>Load your IDEs before the class begins (it's up to you which programming language/IDE you choose to code in; there is an inherent expectation that you can set this up on your own since everyone taking the course is expected to have completed an intro to programming course). </li>
            <li>Phones (and other electronic devices aside from laptops) away during class! If you need to use them, ask your instructor for permission (e.g., for taking photos of codes during homework takeup, for answering important phone calls from parents, for other urgent matters, etc.).</li>
            <li>The class is meant to be interactive. Participate in class discussions, and make sure to ask questions when you are not certain about something.</li>
            <li>Feel free to approach and ask your instructor questions before the class starts, during the break(s), and after class. You can also contact your instructor anytime through email (see his contact at the header of this course webpage)</li>
            <li>There will be coding exercises throughout the lectures. You are expected to try working on these exercises (as I do not necessarily give out the solutions) in-class. I will usually walk around to check on everybody.</li>
            <li>There are homeworks expected to be submitted weekly. They will be released every Saturdays, and will be due the following Saturday. More information about Homework submission in the Homeworks section below.</li>
            <li>There will be a midterm test and a final test for this course. More information will be provided closer to the dates.</li>
            <li>Absences are not encouraged as this course can be fast-paced at times. If there are any absences (planned or unplanned), please write to me via email as soon as possible. Then try to attend the makeup class; another teacher will be teaching it (it is an online class every Sundays, 4:40-6:40 PM). Please reach out to the school (<a href="mailto: info@olympiads.ca">info@olympiads.ca</a>) for the Zoom link. There will also be a Zoom class recording if in case you missed that online class (just reach out to the school again for the Zoom recording). </li>
            <li>The use of any chatbots or AI such as ChatGPT is <span class="alert"><b>strongly discrouraged</b></span> in this course; and moreover, <span class="alert"><b>any work that is submitted that contains content of a generative AI is strictly not allowed</b></span>. <i>When caught, this incident will be reported to the school for disciplinary action.</i> </li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Instructions for submission:</h4>
        If you took my class previously, there will be some slight changes to how you submit homeworks. For each homework you submit, you will do the following steps.
        <ul style="line-height:1.5;">
            <li><b>Step 0:</b> This step may only need to be done once throughout the course. Setup Classkick. See below section for instructions regarding Classkick. </li>
            <li><b>Step 1:</b> First create a folder with the following filename: <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-homework-X</code>, where <code class="inline">X</code> is the HW number. So for example, I will name my folder as <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-homework-01</code> for my first homework submission.</li>
            <li><b>Step 2:</b> Place all files that you would like to submit to this folder. <span class="alert"><b>NEW:</b> Your solution to each problem should be in a separate file. So if there are three questions in the HW for example, then the folder should contain three files, with each file containing the solution to each homework question.</span></li>
            <li><b>Step 3:</b> Once all files that you would like to submit are now in the folder, compress it using any of the zipping softwares. For Windows such as: <a href="https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0">WinRar</a>, <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a>, or <a href="https://www.winzip.com/en/">WinZip</a> (no need to install if your machine already has one). For Mac, a compression utility software is already built-in so no need to install (simply right click on the folder, then click on <code class="inline">Compress</code>). So after compressing, your filename should be something like <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-homework-01.zip</code></li>
            <li><b>Step 4:</b> Go to Classkick. Take a screenshot of your codes and paste them in the homework submission page. It also has the link for submitting the compressed folder; please upload the compressed folder to that link. </li>
            <li><b>Step 5:</b> Feel free to upload as many times as you wish. Previously uploaded files are overwritten. Only the last submission will be graded.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Feel free to ask me questions about homework submission (especially if you're not sure how or where to find the <code class="inline">/PycharmProjects</code> directory) and I will be able to help you.</p>

        <h4>Setting Up Classkick with CCC Level 1 Class</h4>
        If you have a Classkick account (possibly from a previous class that you took), then go <a href="https://app.classkick.com/account/login" target="_blank">here</a> to login. If you forgot your password, you can also click that link to try to recover your account. Once logged in, you will see a green circle on the top right corner. Add the following homework Classkick code for the first homework: <code class="inline">N9S 8IB</code>. By doing this, you would have gained access to future homeworks (no need to always input the Classkick homework code). <br><br>

        If you do not have a Classkick account, create one <a href="https://app.classkick.com/#/signup/student" target="_blank">here</a>. First specify the following Classkick code: <code class="inline">N9S 8IB</code>. Then click on <code class="inline">Sign Up with Username/Email</code>. Create a username that contains your name; write the username and password down in your notebook so you wouldn't forget. By doing this, you would have gained access to future homeworks (no need to always input the Classkick homework code). <br><br>

        In both cases, it is expected that your account will be a "Portfolio" account instead of a "Basic" account. It is this that ensures that you do not need to input the Classkick homework code in order to receive future homeworks. I'll check this during the first day of classes to ensure everyone's account is correct.

        <h3>Accessing Grades and Feedback</h3>
        <p>For those who took my class before, you should be familiar with the grade codes/grade book. I am scrapping that this term, as you can easily access the grades/feedback via Classkick.</p>

        <h3>Grading Scheme</h3>
        <p>For each question/problem, it is worth 5 points. Here is a grading scheme for it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>5 points</b> - If the Online Judge (OJ) deems the answer is correct (passes ALL test cases <i>given a reasonable amount of time</i>). I won't write feedback if you got 5 points - that's how good you are! :) .</li>
            <li><b>4 points</b> - Minor issues. Maybe 1 or 2 failed test cases. But that's ok, I tell you this.</li>
            <li><b>3 points</b> - Around half of the test cases passed, and the rest fail. </li>
            <li><b>2 points</b> - Major issues. Very few test cases passed (possibly 1?) </li>
            <li><b>1 point</b> - Wrong Answer (WA). No test case passed. Any kind of error (syntax, runtime, etc.) caught by the online compiler. </li>
            <li><b>0 point</b> - No attempt. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Majority of the homework questions are actually <i>contest problems</i> and an OJ is grading them. Unfortunately, it's part of the contest that  the judge won't tell you what are the set of inputs that fail -- sometimes, it doesn't even tell you how many fail!</p>

        <p>Another advice that I have when submitting solutions to these problems is that the OJ is very picky! Don't output text that is not required. So for example, don't output <code class="inline">"Please input an integer: "</code> when prompting for an input (unless specified otherwise by the problem!). You also have to be careful with capitalization/lower-case (output to the console must be case-senstive). Don't add extra or remove any characters such as punctuations like spaces, periods, etc. <span class="alert">The expected output of the OJ must match your actual output. </span>Code with efficient runtime is also expected in computing competitions, but we'll talk about it later down the line.</p>

        <p>I was lenient with this grading in the first few homeworks, but will become more strict down the line as I will be mostly relying on the OJ when grading. Not all problems however are being marked with an OJ (only those that can be found in <a href="https://dmoj.ca" target="_blank">DMOJ</a>). To help you with testing your code with the online judge for HW 2, I highly recommend (not required) to sign up for an account with DMOJ and then submit your solutions here: <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc12j3" target="_blank">HW 2 - Q1 (Icon Scaling)</a>, <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc11j2" target="_blank">HW 2 - Q2 (Who Has Seen The Wind?)</a>, <a href="https://dmoj.ca/problem/ccc10j2" target="_blank">HW 2 - Q3 (Up and Down)</a>. <span class="alert">Note that submitting in the DMOJ doesn't mean that you already submit the HW for this class; you still need to follow the proper proecudre for submitting the homework.</span></p>

                For HW 13, make sure to download the <a href="./codes/LightStarterCode.zip" target="_blank">starter code</a> as you will be needing it for that HW. Your final submission for HW 13 will only include a zipped folder of two Java files: <code class="inline">Light.java</code> and <code class="inline">TestLight.java</code> (for students coding in Java), and then a zipped folder of two Python files: <code class="inline">Light.py</code> and <code class="inline">test_light.py</code> (for students coding in Python). Read the instructions carefully from the HW 13 spec (e.g., only <code class="inline">Light.java</code> and <code class="inline">Light.py</code> needs to be modified, and all those that have <code class="inline">to-do</code> would need to be modified)
            <li><b>December 3rd, 2024: </b>
                This announcement provides some bonus points to students who can get a total of at least 11 Homeworks with "P" grades by Dec 23rd. It will be a +5 bonus points towards the Final Exam next month. 
            <li><b>December 2nd, 2024: </b>
                HW 11 (and any other older HW and corrections) are now graded. Send me an email to get some updates on how many "P" grades that you have so far.
            <li><b>November 27th, 2024: </b>
                All homeworks up to HW 15 are now posted in the course webpage. The submission links on Classkick and OSSFiles are now open, in case anybody wants to get a head start on the homeworks. 
            <li><b>November 26th, 2024: </b>
                I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://visualgo.net/en" target="_blank">VisuAlgo.net</a>. It provides some good visualizations for data structures and algorithms. For example, did you know that you can provide your own input list or array of positive integers. And then VisuAlgo can sort those numbers for you! Just choose the sorting algorithm (<code class="inline">InsertionSort</code>, <code class="inline">SelectionSort</code>, or <code class="inline">BubbleSort</code>), and it will show you the steps, the whole process for how you sort it using these algorithms. Click <a href="https://visualgo.net/en/sorting" target="_blank">here</a> for the example. Really useful especially when we start talking about linked lists, trees, and graphs!
            </li>
            <li><b>November 25th, 2024: </b>
                HW 10 has now been graded. Also, the typo for the Selection Sort Python code from the slides is now fixed. Finally, I have misspoken last Saturday (Nov 23rd) when I said our topic for next Saturday (Nov 30th) was on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). What I meant was that on Nov 30th, we will cover Hashing, and then OOP the following Saturday (Dec 7th).
            </li>
            <li><b>November 19th, 2024: </b>
                HW 9 (and any other older HW) have now been graded. Please see Classkick for your grades. If you submit any HW from the past and you did not see your grade, make sure to use the "Raise Hand" functionality of Classkick so that I will be notified that you submitted something from a past HW. Please click the hand icon on the upper right corner of the Classkick on the HW that you'd like me to look at. I will not be browsing through each student to check if any HW was submitted - it is your responsibility to submit HW and notify me (using the Classkick's Raise Hand functionality) for any submission of past HW. Raising hand is not required if it is HW submitted before the due date.
            </li>
            <li><b>November 18th, 2024: </b>
                Homeworks 12-13 are now posted ahead of time, as well as on Classkick/OSSFiles. Grades for previous Homeworks will be posted on Classkick in a few days.

                The midterm survey link is now closed, thank you again for all those who filled out the survey. Seeing that most of you filled it out, I'm happy to announce that everyone in this class (assuming you did not drop past Nov 17th) will receive a +5 bonus points for the upcoming Final Exam in January! 
            </li>
            <li><b>November 14th, 2024: </b>
                I have already updated the Homeworks and Slides for the next two weeks. So this weekend, we'll be covering searching algorithms, following that up with sorting algorithms the following Saturday. The Classkick and OSSFiles submission directory for these HWs will be available by the end of the night. There are an few more resources that I promised last Saturday that I'll upload; they should be coming up tonight or tomorrow. Lastly, the survey will continue to be open until Saturday, Nov 16th. So if you have not done so, please take a few minutes to fill that out (again, the bonus points for Final Exam are still offered up until that day only! We still have not reached our 80% quota).
            </li>
            <li><b>November 9th, 2024: </b>
                Thanks again for everyone who filled out the midterm survey. I have sent an email to everyone who sent me a screenshot of the acknowledgment, and that each has received a +2 bonus points for the Final Exam. Out of the 15 students in the class, not everyone has done it yet but that's ok. Again, 80% of the class must do the survey (which is 12 students) so that everyone gets a +5 for the Final Exam. The midterm survey closes on Saturday, Nov 16th.
            </li>
            <li><b>November 7th, 2024: </b>
                The midterm survey by the way is anonymous (no need to provide name), but if you choose otherwise, you will be incentivized with additional +2 bonus points for the exam. Please do not feel obligated to give your name just for the bonus. Thanks! I will see you all on Saturday!

                Sidenote: The OJ for the midterm is not the same OJ as DMOJ just cause these questions during our midterm was not in a previous contest nor posted on the DMOJ website.
            </li>
            <li><b>November 3rd, 2024: </b>
                The base score for this midterm is 50, then Q1 is worth 25 and Q2 is worth another 25. If your code for Q1 does not compile, you get a 0/25 (same goes for Q2). To get your Q1 score (same method for Q2 score), let <code class="inline">x</code> be the number of test cases you passed (as determined by the OJ) and let <code class="inline">t</code> be the number of total test cases (<code class="inline">t</code> = 6 for Q1 and <code class="inline">t</code> = 13 for Q2). Then the question score out of 25 is (<code class="inline">x</code> + 1)/(<code class="inline">t</code> + 1) * 25 * <code class="inline">EB</code>. For Q1 (and Q2), the <code class="inline">EB</code> = 1.5 (efficiency bonus) is granted if your code rated high in terms of average runtime efficiency (as calculated by the OJ), when ranked amongst your peers (top 3 Python coders and top 2 in Java coders; since there are 9 Python coders and 6 Java coders). The same <code class="inline">EB</code> = 1.5 for Q2. If you did not get the <code class="inline">EB</code>, that's ok -- your <code class="inline">EB</code> = 1. It is possible that your Q1 (or Q2) score exceeds 25. So for the final calculation of the midterm score, just add 50 + Q1 score + Q2 score + Bonus points accumulated in the term. The max score for the midterm is 100, and so if your score exceeds this, it shall get capped and the remainder is carried over as bonus points towards the Final Exam. (Note that the final midterm grade truncates the decimal part.)

Again, you need to submit screenshots to Classkick, and also put all HW files (each HW question solution is its own file) in a single folder with the folder name <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-homework-X.zip</code> (or <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-homework-X-corrections.zip</code> if it is resubmitting). Please use the "raise hand" functionality on Classkick once you have submitted HW or corrections; this will signal me to check up on your homework, and revise the grade.

                For those who attempted the <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/priYZBdqGFjTpwE" target="_blank">challenge problems</a> last Saturday, amazing work to you all!  All solutions can be found <a href="./codes/ccclv1_class4_handout-sol.zip" target="_blank">here</a>. 
            </li>
            <li><b>October 7th, 2024: </b>
                As discussed last Saturday, please see the following <a href="./codes/ccc_lv1_hw3_huffman_solutions.zip" target="_blank">link</a> that contains solutions to the HW 3 for the Huffman Coding that we took up. I won't be finished marking HW 3 up until Thursday (October 10th) maybe? 
            </li>
            <li><b>October 2nd, 2024: </b>
                HW 2's are now graded. Please verify if you are able to view your score/feedbacks onto Classkick. Again, you'll get a "P" if your total is >11.25 and "I" if < 11.25. Please fix your corrections if you got an "I" (no need to do so for "P"), and then resubmit on Classkick and OSSFiles, then use the "raise hand" functionality notifying me that you have done your correction and would like a regrade. Here is a <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/bQnmmDKriwxaFtC" target="_blank">document</a> that gives some tips about solving homework contest problems.
            </li>
            <li><b>September 25th, 2024: </b>
                Additional instruction for the homeworks going forward: Your solution to each problem should be in a separate file. So if there are three questions in the HW for example, then the compressed folder should contain three files, with each file containing the solution to each homework question. It would be highly appreciated if you do your homeworks like this. If you already submitted HW 2 that only contains one singular file, then it's ok; no need to redo it - just ensure that you'll have separate files for each homework question in the future.
            </li>
            <li><b>September 24th, 2024: </b>
                Homework 1 is now graded. The grades and feedback can be viewed over on Classkick.  
                <ul>
                    <li>If you did not receive your grade (equivalent to a blank), I attached a feedback note explaining why you didn't receive it and what you can do. </li>
                    <li>Q1 of Homework 1 is a bit of a give away, but is still worth 5 points.</li>
                    <li>For any question/problem in each homework, it is worth 5 points (no matter how easy or challenging it may be, just to simplify grading). I will announce if there is a question/problem that deviates from this rule.</li>
                    <li>For each homework, your score is totalled and you will receive a "P" (pass) on your report card if you scored 75% or above, and "I" (incomplete) for lower than 75%. For HW 1, all those who scored 11.25 or above out of 15 will get a "P" and those who did the homework but got less than 11.25 will receive an "I".</li>
                    <li>See the above section under "Homeworks" regarding the grading scheme.</li>
                    <li><b>Only for those who got an "I":</b> you are given a chance to fix your corrections and reupload your homework using the filename <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-homework-X-corrections</code>. So for example <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-homework-1-corrections.zip</code>, and don't forget to reupload the screenshots on Classkick. To help me know that you did the corrections and would like a remark, please use the "raise your hand" feature on Classkick.</li>
                    <li>Any corrections and late homeworks are still acceptable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>September 23rd, 2024: </b>
                Homework 3 and 4 are now available (sometimes, I get a little excited and upload homeworks earlier than expected!). Also the Classkick page for Homework 3 is already available (for Homework 4 Classkick links, it will be available this weekend).
            </li>
            <li><b>September 17th, 2024: </b>
                Homework 2 is now available. Upload link for the homework is also accessible on Classkick (note: the HW 1 link submission is different from the HW 2 link).
            </li>
            <li><b>September 16th, 2024: </b>
                For those who attempted the optional homework (the handout I have given out at the end of class last Sep 14th), you can submit it <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/MFLwxozeczHfTPJ" target="_blank">here</a>. It's ok if it works or does not work as expected (something better than nothing). I will discuss the incentives in class this Saturday. This is due on Sep 21st, 4:30 PM (before class starts)
