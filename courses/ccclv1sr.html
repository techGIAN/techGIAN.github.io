        <b>Class Times: </b> Saturdays, 4:40 - 6:40 PM <br>
        <b>Location: </b> Unit 336, <span class="alert"><s>Room 4</s> <b>Room 5</b></span> <br>
        <b>Term Duration: </b> This course will run weekly for <i>twenty-two weeks</i>, starting from January 18th, 2025 to June 14th, 2025. <br>
        <hr>
        
        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>This course is mainly designed for students who intend on participating in computing contests, such as University of Waterloo's <a href="https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/ccc" target="_blank">Canadian Computing Competition (CCC)</a>. The contents of this course will help aid the students tackle challenging computing problems from various computing contests. Compared with CCC Level 1 Jr, this course covers more advanced concepts (including but not limited to disjoint sets, graph search algorithms, advancing sorting algorithms, minimum spanning trees, introductory dynamic programming, counting, number theory, combinatorics, heaps, and segment trees); and discussions on these topics are complemented by examining computing contest problems. Overall, while the course is geared towards students who intend on writing computing contests, it is also open to anyone with basic programming background who intends on expanding programming knowledge, improving problem-solving skills, and/or solving programming challenges. Students who complete this course will gain eligibility to take on the second level of the CCC course. </p>
        <p><b>Course Prerequisites: </b> Computer Contest Course Level 1 (taken in Fall 2024) </p>
        <p class="alert"><i><b>Note: </b> Please contact your instructor if you have not completed the prerequisites for this course.</i> </p>

        <h3>Course Policies</h3>
        <ol style="line-height:1.5;">
            <li>Please come on time (~10-15 minutes before the start of the class time).</li>
            <li>Have your laptop computer ready fully-charged (or at least with battery); if your laptop is close to 0%, make sure to bring a charger to class (always bring a charger!).  <span class="alert">Note that a tablet or a phone cannot be used as a replacement for a laptop.</span></li>
            <li>Load your IDEs before the class begins (it's up to you which programming language/IDE you choose to code in; there is an inherent expectation that you can set this up on your own since everyone taking the course is expected to have completed an intro to programming course). </li>
            <li>Phones (and other electronic devices aside from laptops) away during class! If you need to use them, ask your instructor for permission (e.g., for taking photos of codes during homework takeup, for answering important phone calls from parents, for other urgent matters, etc.).</li>
            <li>The class is meant to be interactive. Participate in class discussions, and make sure to ask questions when you are not certain about something.</li>
            <li>Feel free to approach and ask your instructor questions before the class starts, during the break(s), and after class. You can also contact your instructor anytime through email (see his contact at the header of this course webpage)</li>
            <li>There will be coding exercises throughout the lectures. You are expected to try working on these exercises (as I do not necessarily give out the solutions) in-class. I will usually walk around to check on everybody.</li>
            <li>There are homeworks expected to be submitted weekly. They will be released every Saturdays, and will be due the following Saturday. More information about Homework submission in the Homeworks section below.</li>
            <li>Starting Week 4 (and some weeks in the term), there will be pop quizzes (unannounced). It is a quick 10-15 minute quiz to evaluate how much you have learned in the course recently (also as a way for you to keep yourself on top of the material). It is closed-books/notes, purely conceptual questions, and no coding question. It will be done at the beginning of class (pen-and-paper). It is to be announced later on whether grades shall be included in the gradebook or as part of bonus points for the tests/exam.</li>
            <li>There will be two tests and a final exam for this course. More information will be provided closer to the dates.</li>
            <li>Absences are not encouraged as this course can be fast-paced at times. If there are any absences (planned or unplanned), please write to me via email as soon as possible. Then try to attend the makeup class; another teacher will be teaching it (it is an online class every Sundays, 4:40-6:40 PM). Please reach out to the school (<a href="mailto: info@olympiads.ca">info@olympiads.ca</a>) for the Zoom link. There will also be a Zoom class recording if in case you missed that online class (just reach out to the school again for the Zoom recording). </li>
            <li>The use of any chatbots or AI such as ChatGPT is <span class="alert"><b>strongly discrouraged</b></span> in this course; and moreover, <span class="alert"><b>any work that is submitted that contains content of a generative AI is strictly not allowed</b></span>. <i>When caught, this incident will be reported to the school for disciplinary action.</i> </li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Course Materials</h3>
            The course is split into five parts. Each part is its own directory, and each directory with its own password. Your teacher will share the password with you at the beginning of class. If you forget or do not know the password, please email your teacher asking for the password for a specific part. Once you receive the password, please keep a copy of the passwords in your notebook. Homeworks and slides can be found here:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/42ALRzeP3JK57HY" target="_blank">Part One</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/MQEre76Knw6zZbD" target="_blank">Part Two</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/njGYC5dawdxbXmB" target="_blank">Part Three</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/3DeLWB58QcF6QG6" target="_blank">Part Four</a></li>
                <li>Part Five</li>
            </ul>
            Once you have accessed the materials, please download the PDFs. It's better to view the slides in your PDF viewer (like Preview or Adobe Reader) or possibly in the browser, than on OnlyOffice of OSSFiles.

        <h3>Homework Submission</h3>
        <p>Please see the above course materials section for a link to the Honework Questions.</p>
        <p>The following table summarizes the important dates about homeworks. The <b>Post Date</b> is a deadline for me to upload your HW. The <b>Due Date</b> is a deadline for submitting Homework (Attempt 1), at 4:15 PM (Classkick HW submission portal and OSSFiles portal are frozen). We take up the solutions on the same day that it is due at 4:40 PM. HW are then be graded before the <b>Marked Date</b>, which is my deadline to deliver the grade and feedback on Classkick. Afterwhich, Classkick (and OSSFiles) unfreezes and you can resubmit any Homework (including missed HW or resubmitting corrections for Attempt 2); make sure to use the <b>Raise Hand</b> functionality when resubmitting.  </p>

        <h4>Part 1 (Concepts)</h4>
        You are given a one page on Classkick (more info on Classkick below) to write your answers to the conceptual questions. Show all work as needed. It must fit that one page; otherwise, your answers are too long and you may need to cut down. Another option is to type your answers in a Word Processor, and then take a screenshot and paste there. Another alternative is to write your answers on a piece of paper and then attach it there. Regardless of your method, you still need to be able to fit your work in that single page.

        <h4>Part 2 (Contest Problem)</h4>
        Read the contest problem carefully, including the input and output specifications, and analyze as well the sample input and output. Then code a solution for the problem being asked (either in Python, Java, or C++). See below for instructions for how to submit your solutions:
        <ul style="line-height:1.5;">
            <li><b>Step 0:</b> This step may only need to be done once throughout the course. Setup Classkick. See below section for instructions regarding Classkick. </li>
            <li><b>Step 1:</b> First create a folder with the following filename: <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-homework-X-Sr</code>, where <code class="inline">X</code> is the HW number. So for example, I will name my folder as <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-homework-01-Sr</code> for my first homework submission. <span class="alert"><i>If you took my CCC class last Fall 2024 term, this folder name format is not that different, with the exception of the "Sr" suffix in the filename.</i></span></li>
            <li><b>Step 2:</b> Place all files that you would like to submit to this folder. Your solution to each problem should be in a separate file. So if there are three contest problems in the HW for example, then the folder should contain three files, with each file containing the solution to each homework question.</li>
            <li><b>Step 3:</b> Once all files that you would like to submit are now in the folder, compress it using any of the zipping softwares. For Windows such as: <a href="https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0">WinRar</a>, <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a>, or <a href="https://www.winzip.com/en/">WinZip</a> (no need to install if your machine already has one). For Mac, a compression utility software is already built-in so no need to install (simply right click on the folder, then click on <code class="inline">Compress</code>). So after compressing, your filename should be something like <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-homework-01-Sr.zip</code></li>
            <li><b>Step 4:</b> Go to Classkick. Take a screenshot of your codes and paste them in the homework submission page. It also has the link for submitting the compressed folder; please upload the compressed folder to that link. </li>
            <li><b>Step 5:</b> Feel free to upload as many times as you wish. Previously uploaded files are overwritten. Only the last submission will be graded.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Feel free to ask me questions about homework submission (especially if you're not sure how or where to find the project directory) and I will be able to help you.</p>

        <h4>Setting Up Classkick with CCC Level 1 Class</h4>
        If you have a Classkick account (possibly from a previous class that you took), then go <a href="https://app.classkick.com/account/login" target="_blank">here</a> to login. If you forgot your password, you can also click that link to try to recover your account. Once logged in, you will see a green circle on the top right corner. Add the following homework Classkick code for the first homework: <code class="inline">P2W 49D</code>. By doing this, you would have gained access to future homeworks (no need to always input the Classkick homework code). <br><br>

        If you do not have a Classkick account, create one <a href="https://app.classkick.com/#/signup/student" target="_blank">here</a>. First specify the following Classkick code: <code class="inline">P2W 49D</code>. Then click on <code class="inline">Sign Up with Username/Email</code>. Create a username that contains your name; write the username and password down in your notebook so you wouldn't forget. By doing this, you would have gained access to future homeworks (no need to always input the Classkick homework code). <br><br>

        In both cases, it is expected that your account will be a "Portfolio" account instead of a "Basic" account. It is this that ensures that you do not need to input the Classkick homework code in order to receive future homeworks. I'll check this during the first day of classes to ensure everyone's account is correct. If it is not setup correctly, that is ok; I will let you know and we can fix it together.
        <hr>

        <h3>Accessing Grades and Feedback</h3>
        <p>All grades and feedback will be posted on Classkick. I will release announcements whenever I complete marking. </p>

        <h3>Grading Scheme</h3>
        <p>Your grade for Part 1 will be added with Part 2. For Part 1, the highest possible score can always vary, depending on the Homework (grading scheme taken up during Homework Takeup). For Part 2, the highest possible score for each problem is always out of 5:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>5 points</b> - If the Online Judge (OJ) deems the answer is correct (passes ALL test cases <i>given a reasonable amount of time</i>). I won't write feedback if you got 5 points - that's how good you are! :) .</li>
            <li><b>4 points</b> - Minor issues. Maybe 1 or 2 failed test cases. But that's ok, I tell you this.</li>
            <li><b>3 points</b> - Around half of the test cases passed, and the rest fail. </li>
            <li><b>2 points</b> - Major issues. Very few test cases passed (possibly 1?) </li>
            <li><b>1 point</b> - Wrong Answer (WA). No test case passed. Any kind of error (syntax, runtime, etc.) caught by the online compiler. </li>
            <li><b>0 point</b> - No attempt. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Majority of the homework questions are actually <i>contest problems</i> and an OJ is grading them. Unfortunately, it's part of the contest that the judge won't tell you what are the set of inputs that fail -- sometimes, it doesn't even tell you how many fail!</p>

        <p>Another advice that I have when submitting solutions to these problems is that the OJ is very picky! Don't output text that is not required. So for example, don't print <code class="inline">"Please input an integer: "</code> when prompting for an input (unless specified otherwise by the problem!). You also have to be careful with capitalization/lower-case (output to the console must be case-senstive). Don't add extra or remove any characters such as punctuations like spaces, periods, etc. <span class="alert">The expected output of the OJ must match your actual output. </span>Code with efficient runtime is also expected in computing competitions.</p>

        <h3>Total Score</h3>
        For each Homework, I tally your total scores. If it is 75% (or above) in terms of percentage, then you will be marked "P" in the report card for that Homework. If it is below that, then it is "I". If no submission attempt made, then it will be blank.If you need to resubmit to fix corrections (up to Attempt 2) or submitting a missed HW, then the filename should then have a format be <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-homework-01-Sr-resubmitted.zip</code>. <span class="alert">When resubmitting HW, make sure to use the <b>Raise Hand</b> functionality of Classkick; otherwise, they will not be seen and thus not be graded.</span>
        <hr>

        <h3>DMOJ Online Judge</h3>
            You are not required to create an account in <a href="https://dmoj.ca" target="_blank">DMOJ</a>. But if you have one, you can use it to login to DMOJ to be able to submit solutions (viewing problems does not require an account though!). It is not required for you to submit your solutions to DMOJ; <span class="alert">you still have to submit your solutions according to the method of submitting HW in this course!</span>. The sample input/output in the HW specifications may not be enough to check the correctness of your code solutions, so visiting DMOJ may be able to help.

                I have graded your Test 02 already but can't help feeling disappointed. Please see your grades on Classkick (I will hand you back your paper test results on Saturday next week.) Anyways, I'll give everyone who didn't do well on Part B of the Test 02 a second chance. If you do it, you'll get a increase of up to 15 points added only to the Part B potion of the test. But note it has to be before the due date. See weekly section below for more information.
