        <b>Instructor:</b> Mr. Gian Alix <br>
        <b>Email:</b> <a href="mailto: galix@olympiadsmail.ca">galix@olympiadsmail.ca</a> <br>
        <b>Class Times: </b> Saturdays, 4:40 - 6:40 PM <br>
        <b>Location: </b> Unit 336, Room 4 <br>
        <b>Term Duration: </b> This course will run weekly for <i>twenty-two weeks</i>, starting from January 18th, 2025 to June 14th, 2025. <br>
        <hr>
        
        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>This course is mainly designed for students who intend on participating in computing contests, such as University of Waterloo's <a href="https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/ccc" target="_blank">Canadian Computing Competition (CCC)</a>. The contents of this course will help aid the students tackle challenging computing problems from various computing contests. Compared with CCC Level 1 Jr, this course covers more advanced concepts (including but not limited to disjoint sets, graph search algorithms, advancing sorting algorithms, minimum spanning trees, introductory dynamic programming, counting, number theory, combinatorics, heaps, and segment trees); and discussions on these topics are complemented by examining computing contest problems. Overall, while the course is geared towards students who intend on writing computing contests, it is also open to anyone with basic programming background who intends on expanding programming knowledge, improving problem-solving skills, and/or solving programming challenges. Students who complete this course will gain eligibility to take on the second level of the CCC course. </p>
        <p><b>Course Prerequisites: </b> Computer Contest Course Level 1 (taken in Fall 2024) </p>
        <p class="alert"><i><b>Note: </b> Please contact your instructor if you have not completed the prerequisites for this course.</i> </p>

        <h3>Course Policies</h3>
        <ol style="line-height:1.5;">
            <li>Please come on time (~10-15 minutes before the start of the class time).</li>
            <li>Have your laptop computer ready fully-charged (or at least with battery); if your laptop is close to 0%, make sure to bring a charger to class (always bring a charger!).  <span class="alert">Note that a tablet or a phone cannot be used as a replacement for a laptop.</span></li>
            <li>Load your IDEs before the class begins (it's up to you which programming language/IDE you choose to code in; there is an inherent expectation that you can set this up on your own since everyone taking the course is expected to have completed an intro to programming course). </li>
            <li>Phones (and other electronic devices aside from laptops) away during class! If you need to use them, ask your instructor for permission (e.g., for taking photos of codes during homework takeup, for answering important phone calls from parents, for other urgent matters, etc.).</li>
            <li>The class is meant to be interactive. Participate in class discussions, and make sure to ask questions when you are not certain about something.</li>
            <li>Feel free to approach and ask your instructor questions before the class starts, during the break(s), and after class. You can also contact your instructor anytime through email (see his contact at the header of this course webpage)</li>
            <li>There will be coding exercises throughout the lectures. You are expected to try working on these exercises (as I do not necessarily give out the solutions) in-class. I will usually walk around to check on everybody.</li>
            <li>There are homeworks expected to be submitted weekly. They will be released every Saturdays, and will be due the following Saturday. More information about Homework submission in the Homeworks section below.</li>
            <li>Starting Week 4 (and some weeks in the term), there will be pop quizzes (unannounced). It is a quick 10-15 minute quiz to evaluate how much you have learned in the course recently (also as a way for you to keep yourself on top of the material). It is closed-books/notes, purely conceptual questions, and no coding question. It will be done at the beginning of class (pen-and-paper). It is to be announced later on whether grades shall be included in the gradebook or as part of bonus points for the tests/exam.</li>
            <li>There will be two tests and a final exam for this course. More information will be provided closer to the dates.</li>
            <li>Absences are not encouraged as this course can be fast-paced at times. If there are any absences (planned or unplanned), please write to me via email as soon as possible. Then try to attend the makeup class; another teacher will be teaching it (it is an online class every Sundays, 4:40-6:40 PM). Please reach out to the school (<a href="mailto: info@olympiads.ca">info@olympiads.ca</a>) for the Zoom link. There will also be a Zoom class recording if in case you missed that online class (just reach out to the school again for the Zoom recording). </li>
            <li>The use of any chatbots or AI such as ChatGPT is <span class="alert"><b>strongly discrouraged</b></span> in this course; and moreover, <span class="alert"><b>any work that is submitted that contains content of a generative AI is strictly not allowed</b></span>. <i>When caught, this incident will be reported to the school for disciplinary action.</i> </li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>

        <h3>Course Materials</h3>
            The course is split into five parts. Each part is its own directory, and each directory with its own password. Your teacher will share the password with you at the beginning of class. If you forget or do not know the password, please email your teacher asking for the password for a specific part. Once you receive the password, please keep a copy of the passwords in your notebook. Homeworks and slides can be found here:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/42ALRzeP3JK57HY" target="_blank">Part One</a></li>
                <li>Part Two</li>
                <li>Part Three</li>
                <li>Part Four</li>
                <li>Part Five</li>
            </ul>
            Once you have accessed the materials, please download the PDFs. It's better to view the slides in your PDF viewer (like Preview or Adobe Reader) or possibly in the browser, than on OnlyOffice of OSSFiles.
        <hr>

        <h3>Homework Submission</h3>
        <p>Please see the above course materials section for a link to the Honework Questions.</p>
        <p>The following table summarizes the important dates about homeworks. The <b>Post Date</b> is a deadline for me to upload your HW. The <b>Due Date</b> is a deadline for submitting Homework (Attempt 1), at 4:15 PM (Classkick HW submission portal and OSSFiles portal are frozen). We take up the solutions on the same day that it is due at 4:40 PM. HW are then be graded before the <b>Marked Date</b>, which is my deadline to deliver the grade and feedback on Classkick. Afterwhich, Classkick (and OSSFiles) unfreezes and you can resubmit any Homework (including missed HW or resubmitting corrections for Attempt 2); make sure to use the <b>Raise Hand</b> functionality when resubmitting.  </p>

        <h4>Part 1 (Concepts)</h4>
        You are given a one page on Classkick (more info on Classkick below) to write your answers to the conceptual questions. Show all work as needed. It must fit that one page; otherwise, your answers are too long and you may need to cut down. Another option is to type your answers in a Word Processor, and then take a screenshot and paste there. Another alternative is to write your answers on a piece of paper and then attach it there. Regardless of your method, you still need to be able to fit your work in that single page.

        <h4>Part 2 (Contest Problem)</h4>
        Read the contest problem carefully, including the input and output specifications, and analyze as well the sample input and output. Then code a solution for the problem being asked (either in Python, Java, or C++). See below for instructions for how to submit your solutions:
        <ul style="line-height:1.5;">
            <li><b>Step 0:</b> This step may only need to be done once throughout the course. Setup Classkick. See below section for instructions regarding Classkick. </li>
            <li><b>Step 1:</b> First create a folder with the following filename: <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-homework-X-Sr</code>, where <code class="inline">X</code> is the HW number. So for example, I will name my folder as <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-homework-01-Sr</code> for my first homework submission. <span class="alert"><i>If you took my CCC class last Fall 2024 term, this folder name format is not that different, with the exception of the "Sr" suffix in the filename.</i></span></li>
            <li><b>Step 2:</b> Place all files that you would like to submit to this folder. Your solution to each problem should be in a separate file. So if there are three contest problems in the HW for example, then the folder should contain three files, with each file containing the solution to each homework question.</li>
            <li><b>Step 3:</b> Once all files that you would like to submit are now in the folder, compress it using any of the zipping softwares. For Windows such as: <a href="https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0">WinRar</a>, <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a>, or <a href="https://www.winzip.com/en/">WinZip</a> (no need to install if your machine already has one). For Mac, a compression utility software is already built-in so no need to install (simply right click on the folder, then click on <code class="inline">Compress</code>). So after compressing, your filename should be something like <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-homework-01-Sr.zip</code></li>
            <li><b>Step 4:</b> Go to Classkick. Take a screenshot of your codes and paste them in the homework submission page. It also has the link for submitting the compressed folder; please upload the compressed folder to that link. </li>
            <li><b>Step 5:</b> Feel free to upload as many times as you wish. Previously uploaded files are overwritten. Only the last submission will be graded.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Feel free to ask me questions about homework submission (especially if you're not sure how or where to find the project directory) and I will be able to help you.</p>

        <h4>Setting Up Classkick with CCC Level 1 Class</h4>
        If you have a Classkick account (possibly from a previous class that you took), then go <a href="https://app.classkick.com/account/login" target="_blank">here</a> to login. If you forgot your password, you can also click that link to try to recover your account. Once logged in, you will see a green circle on the top right corner. Add the following homework Classkick code for the first homework: <code class="inline">P2W 49D</code>. By doing this, you would have gained access to future homeworks (no need to always input the Classkick homework code). <br><br>

        If you do not have a Classkick account, create one <a href="https://app.classkick.com/#/signup/student" target="_blank">here</a>. First specify the following Classkick code: <code class="inline">P2W 49D</code>. Then click on <code class="inline">Sign Up with Username/Email</code>. Create a username that contains your name; write the username and password down in your notebook so you wouldn't forget. By doing this, you would have gained access to future homeworks (no need to always input the Classkick homework code). <br><br>

        In both cases, it is expected that your account will be a "Portfolio" account instead of a "Basic" account. It is this that ensures that you do not need to input the Classkick homework code in order to receive future homeworks. I'll check this during the first day of classes to ensure everyone's account is correct. If it is not setup correctly, that is ok; I will let you know and we can fix it together.
        <hr>

        <h3>Accessing Grades and Feedback</h3>
        <p>All grades and feedback will be posted on Classkick. I will release announcements whenever I complete marking. </p>

        <h3>Grading Scheme</h3>
        <p>Your grade for Part 1 will be added with Part 2. For Part 1, the highest possible score can always vary, depending on the Homework (grading scheme taken up during Homework Takeup). For Part 2, the highest possible score for each problem is always out of 5:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>5 points</b> - If the Online Judge (OJ) deems the answer is correct (passes ALL test cases <i>given a reasonable amount of time</i>). I won't write feedback if you got 5 points - that's how good you are! :) .</li>
            <li><b>4 points</b> - Minor issues. Maybe 1 or 2 failed test cases. But that's ok, I tell you this.</li>
            <li><b>3 points</b> - Around half of the test cases passed, and the rest fail. </li>
            <li><b>2 points</b> - Major issues. Very few test cases passed (possibly 1?) </li>
            <li><b>1 point</b> - Wrong Answer (WA). No test case passed. Any kind of error (syntax, runtime, etc.) caught by the online compiler. </li>
            <li><b>0 point</b> - No attempt. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Majority of the homework questions are actually <i>contest problems</i> and an OJ is grading them. Unfortunately, it's part of the contest that the judge won't tell you what are the set of inputs that fail -- sometimes, it doesn't even tell you how many fail!</p>

        <p>Another advice that I have when submitting solutions to these problems is that the OJ is very picky! Don't output text that is not required. So for example, don't print <code class="inline">"Please input an integer: "</code> when prompting for an input (unless specified otherwise by the problem!). You also have to be careful with capitalization/lower-case (output to the console must be case-senstive). Don't add extra or remove any characters such as punctuations like spaces, periods, etc. <span class="alert">The expected output of the OJ must match your actual output. </span>Code with efficient runtime is also expected in computing competitions.</p>

        <h3>Total Score</h3>
        For each Homework, I tally your total scores. If it is 75% (or above) in terms of percentage, then you will be marked "P" in the report card for that Homework. If it is below that, then it is "I". If no submission attempt made, then it will be blank.If you need to resubmit to fix corrections (up to Attempt 2) or submitting a missed HW, then the filename should then have a format be <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-homework-01-Sr-resubmitted.zip</code>. <span class="alert">When resubmitting HW, make sure to use the <b>Raise Hand</b> functionality of Classkick; otherwise, they will not be seen and thus not be graded.</span>
        <hr>

        <h3>DMOJ Online Judge</h3>
            You are not required to create an account in <a href="https://dmoj.ca" target="_blank">DMOJ</a>. But if you have one, you can use it to login to DMOJ to be able to submit solutions (viewing problems does not require an account though!). It is not required for you to submit your solutions to DMOJ; <span class="alert">you still have to submit your solutions according to the method of submitting HW in this course!</span>. The sample input/output in the HW specifications may not be enough to check the correctness of your code solutions, so visiting DMOJ may be able to help.

                I highly commend one student who tried (and submitted) the Bank Account In-class Exercise. I won't mention their name as they might not like to be the centre of attention, but they got a +5 bonus points from me for the Final Exam for being the only one to do it (you know who you are :D ). I haven't checked their code if they got the answer right, but I want to reward students who have attempted at least. Anyways, here are the solutions: <a href="./codes/BankAccount.java" target="_blank">BankAccount.java</a> and <a href="./codes/bank_account.py" target="_blank">bank_account.py</a>
            <li><b>December 18th, 2024: </b>
                As promised, here is a video taking up the solutions to HW 13: <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/qEqnGT8NzA5TGw3" target="_blank">for Java</a>, <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/sQW243XwZg2pj4E" target="_blank">for Python</a>. Here are the solutions to the code: <a href="./codes/LightSol/Light.java" target="_blank">Light.java</a> and <a href="./codes/LightSol/Light.py" target="_blank">Light.py</a>. Unfortunately, we do not have the time to cover these solutions in-class this Saturday. So please take some time to go over these videos and code solutions.
            <li><b>December 9th, 2024: </b>
                For the Light HW, please read the HW specs carefully. Make sure to update only <code class="inline">Light.java</code> or <code class="inline">Light.py</code>, and only modify those codes with the <code class="inline">to-do</code>. The test files must not be updated by any means, although you have to submit both <code class="inline">Light</code> and test files as part of your HW 13 submission.
            <li><b>December 8th, 2024: </b>
                Not sure why the starter codes were different from the ones I have shown, but please use the following starter codes for your HW 13 (Light OOP HW): <a href="./codes/Light.java" target="_blank">Light.java</a>,  <a href="./codes/TestLight.java" target="_blank">TestLight.java</a>, <a href="./codes/Light.py" target="_blank">Light.py</a>,  <a href="./codes/test_light.py" target="_blank">test_light.py</a>.
            <li><b>December 5th, 2024: </b>
                For HW 13, make sure to download the <a href="./codes/LightStarterCode.zip" target="_blank">starter code</a> as you will be needing it for that HW. Your final submission for HW 13 will only include a zipped folder of two Java files: <code class="inline">Light.java</code> and <code class="inline">TestLight.java</code> (for students coding in Java), and then a zipped folder of two Python files: <code class="inline">Light.py</code> and <code class="inline">test_light.py</code> (for students coding in Python). Read the instructions carefully from the HW 13 spec (e.g., only <code class="inline">Light.java</code> and <code class="inline">Light.py</code> needs to be modified, and all those that have <code class="inline">to-do</code> would need to be modified)

                I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://visualgo.net/en" target="_blank">VisuAlgo.net</a>. It provides some good visualizations for data structures and algorithms. For example, did you know that you can provide your own input list or array of positive integers. And then VisuAlgo can sort those numbers for you! Just choose the sorting algorithm (<code class="inline">InsertionSort</code>, <code class="inline">SelectionSort</code>, or <code class="inline">BubbleSort</code>), and it will show you the steps, the whole process for how you sort it using these algorithms. Click <a href="https://visualgo.net/en/sorting" target="_blank">here</a> for the example. Really useful especially when we start talking about linked lists, trees, and graphs!

            <li><b>November 25th, 2024: </b>
                HW 10 has now been graded. Also, the typo for the Selection Sort Python code from the slides is now fixed. Finally, I have misspoken last Saturday (Nov 23rd) when I said our topic for next Saturday (Nov 30th) was on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). What I meant was that on Nov 30th, we will cover Hashing, and then OOP the following Saturday (Dec 7th).

                HW 9 (and any other older HW) have now been graded. Please see Classkick for your grades. If you submit any HW from the past and you did not see your grade, make sure to use the "Raise Hand" functionality of Classkick so that I will be notified that you submitted something from a past HW. Please click the hand icon on the upper right corner of the Classkick on the HW that you'd like me to look at. I will not be browsing through each student to check if any HW was submitted - it is your responsibility to submit HW and notify me (using the Classkick's Raise Hand functionality) for any submission of past HW. Raising hand is not required if it is HW submitted before the due date.
            </li>
            <li><b>November 18th, 2024: </b>
                Homeworks 12-13 are now posted ahead of time, as well as on Classkick/OSSFiles. Grades for previous Homeworks will be posted on Classkick in a few days.

                I have already updated the Homeworks and Slides for the next two weeks. So this weekend, we'll be covering searching algorithms, following that up with sorting algorithms the following Saturday. The Classkick and OSSFiles submission directory for these HWs will be available by the end of the night. There are an few more resources that I promised last Saturday that I'll upload; they should be coming up tonight or tomorrow. Lastly, the survey will continue to be open until Saturday, Nov 16th.

                Thanks again for everyone who filled out the midterm survey. I have sent an email to everyone who sent me a screenshot of the acknowledgment, and that each has received a +2 bonus points for the Final Exam. Out of the 15 students in the class, not everyone has done it yet but that's ok. Again, 80% of the class must do the survey (which is 12 students) so that everyone gets a +5 for the Final Exam. The midterm survey closes on Saturday, Nov 16th.

                The midterm survey by the way is anonymous (no need to provide name), but if you choose otherwise, you will be incentivized with additional +2 bonus points for the exam. Please do not feel obligated to give your name just for the bonus. Thanks! I will see you all on Saturday!

                Sidenote: The OJ for the midterm is not the same OJ as DMOJ just cause these questions during our midterm was not in a previous contest nor posted on the DMOJ website.
            </li>
            <li><b>November 3rd, 2024: </b>
                The base score for this midterm is 50, then Q1 is worth 25 and Q2 is worth another 25. If your code for Q1 does not compile, you get a 0/25 (same goes for Q2). To get your Q1 score (same method for Q2 score), let <code class="inline">x</code> be the number of test cases you passed (as determined by the OJ) and let <code class="inline">t</code> be the number of total test cases (<code class="inline">t</code> = 6 for Q1 and <code class="inline">t</code> = 13 for Q2). Then the question score out of 25 is (<code class="inline">x</code> + 1)/(<code class="inline">t</code> + 1) * 25 * <code class="inline">EB</code>. For Q1 (and Q2), the <code class="inline">EB</code> = 1.5 (efficiency bonus) is granted if your code rated high in terms of average runtime efficiency (as calculated by the OJ), when ranked amongst your peers (top 3 Python coders and top 2 in Java coders; since there are 9 Python coders and 6 Java coders). The same <code class="inline">EB</code> = 1.5 for Q2. If you did not get the <code class="inline">EB</code>, that's ok -- your <code class="inline">EB</code> = 1. It is possible that your Q1 (or Q2) score exceeds 25. So for the final calculation of the midterm score, just add 50 + Q1 score + Q2 score + Bonus points accumulated in the term. The max score for the midterm is 100, and so if your score exceeds this, it shall get capped and the remainder is carried over as bonus points towards the Final Exam. (Note that the final midterm grade truncates the decimal part.)

I will explain in another announcement how midterm scores are computed. But so far, I'm actually glad and impressed by everyone's performance this evening!

                Additional instruction for the homeworks going forward: Your solution to each problem should be in a separate file. So if there are three questions in the HW for example, then the compressed folder should contain three files, with each file containing the solution to each homework question. It would be highly appreciated if you do your homeworks like this. If you already submitted HW 2 that only contains one singular file, then it's ok; no need to redo it - just ensure that you'll have separate files for each homework question in the future.

                    <li>For any question/problem in each homework, it is worth 5 points (no matter how easy or challenging it may be, just to simplify grading). I will announce if there is a question/problem that deviates from this rule.</li>
                    <li>For each homework, your score is totalled and you will receive a "P" (pass) on your report card if you scored 75% or above, and "I" (incomplete) for lower than 75%. For HW 1, all those who scored 11.25 or above out of 15 will get a "P" and those who did the homework but got less than 11.25 will receive an "I".</li>
