        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>This course is designed as an introductory programming course specifically in the programming language Java. In this course, students will learn basic programming concepts, such as variables, operators, conditional statements, writing iterative programs, simple data structures (e.g., arrays, lists, sets), recursion, basic object-oriented programming, and software testing. By the end of the course, students will gain programming skills needed in various courses such as AP-Computer Science, Computing Contest Courses, and ICS 3U. </p>
        <p><b>Course Prerequisites: </b> Grade 9 Math - Curriculum </p>
        <p class="alert"><i><b>Note: </b> Please contact your instructor if you have not completed the prerequisites for this course.</i> </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Please come on time (~10-15 minutes before the start of the class time).</li>
            <li>Have your laptop computer ready fully-charged (or at least with battery); if your laptop is close to 0%, make sure to bring a charger to class (always bring a charger!).  <span class="alert">Note that you a tablet or a phone cannot be used as a replacement for a laptop.</span></li>
            <li>Load Java/Eclipse IDE before the class begins (see Other Resources section below for more information about software installation). </li>
            <li>Phones (and other electronic devices aside from laptops) away during class! If you need to use them, ask your instructor for permission.</li>

            <li>Feel free to approach and ask your instructor questions before the class starts, during the break(s), and after class. You can also contact your instructor anytime through email (see his contact at the header of this course webpage)</li>
            <li>There will be coding exercises throughout the lectures. You are expected to try working on these exercises (as I do not necessarily give out the solutions) in-class. I will usually walk around to check on everybody.</li>
            <li>There are homeworks expected to be submitted weekly. They will be released every Tuesdays, and will be due the following Tuesday. More information about Homework submission in the Homeworks section below.</li>
            <li>There will be a midterm test and a final exam for this course. More information will be provided closer to the dates.</li>

        <h3>Homework Submission</h3>
        <p>The school posts homework questions on the Meritus website, but the ones that I would like you to solve instead will be posted here (the questions are slightly modified so pay attention that you work on these questions instead). They will be posted here in this section every Tuesday (the first one will be posted on July 2nd, 2024 and is due next Tuesday on July 9th, 2024):</p>
