            <ol style="line-height:1.5;">
                <li>This class requires that you have <span class="alert">stable internet connection</span>, as well as access to a <span class="alert">web camera</span> throughout the <i>duration of the lecture</i>. Please log in to Zoom ~10-15 minutes before the start of the class time. The Zoom link can be found in your Olympiads account; if you have any trouble accessing the link, please reach out to the school <a href="mailto: info@olympiads.ca">info@olympiads.ca</a>. </li>
                <li>Load Java/Eclipse IDE before the class begins. Your teacher will go over the installation of the required software on the first day of class. If you miss it, please watch the video recording of the class as I will guide you through the installation process. Also see <a href="#otherRes">Other Resources</a> section below for more information about software installation. </li>
                <li>The only electronic device permitted are laptops/desktop computers. Devices such as phones, mobile devices, gaming consoles, and tablets must be put away. If you feel the need to use them, please ask your instructor for permission.</li>
                <li>Lecture materials like slides are provided by the school. They can be found in your Olympiads account; reach out to the school if you have trouble accessing them. Please download a copy to your local at the beginning of the class (note that they will be taken down from the Olympiads website at any point in time, so download a copy!). I will provide other necessary learning resources in this class like supplementary codes.</li>
                <li>During class, please focus your attention on the teacher and avoid visiting unnecessary websites like YouTube, Facebook, social media platforms, or game sites. </li>
                <li>The class is meant to be interactive. Participate in class discussions, and make sure to ask questions when you are not certain about something. Either type your question in the chatbox, OR click the "raise hand" button on your Zoom -- the instructor will call you and then you can feel free to unmute yourself and speak.</li>
                <li>There will be coding exercises throughout the lectures. You are expected to try working on these exercises (as I do not necessarily give out the solutions). Because it will be hard to check if everybody is doing the work, then I will trust that you are actually working on these exercises. For those exercises that I provide solutions, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't try it; please still try and do your best because "doing" is the best way of "learning" coding and getting better at it.</li>
                <li>There are homeworks expected to be submitted every class. More information about the Homeworks in the Homework section.</li>
                <li>There will be a midterm test and a final exam for this course. More information will be provided closer to the dates.</li>
                <li>The use of any chatbots or AI such as ChatGPT is <span class="alert"><b>strongly discrouraged</b></span> in this course; and moreover, <span class="alert"><b>any work that is submitted that contains content of a generative AI is strictly not allowed</b></span>. <i>When caught, this incident will be reported to the school for disciplinary action.</i> </li>

            <h4>Instructions for submission:</h4>
            <ol style="line-height:1.5;">
                <li>First create a folder with the following filename: <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-homework-xx</code>, where <code class="inline">xx</code> is the HW number. So for example, I will name my folder as <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-homework-01</code> for my first homework submission.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the <code class="inline">/eclipse-workspace</code> directory in your system, then you will be able to find the Java files that your wish to submit in one of the project folders.</li>
                <li>Copy-paste all files that you would like to submit to the <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-homework-xx</code> folder.</li>
                <li>Remember that each question should be in its own file.</li>
                <li>Once all files that you would like to submit are now in the folder, compress it using any of the zipping softwares. For Windows such as: <a href="https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0">WinRar</a>, <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a>, or <a href="https://www.winzip.com/en/">WinZip</a> (no need to install if your machine already has one). For Mac, a compression utility software is already built-in so no need to install (simply right click on the folder, then click on <code class="inline">Compress</code>).</li>
                <li>Upload the zipped folder to the OSSFiles directory specified on the Classkick Homework; remember that each Homework gets a different link! </li>
                <li>Feel free to upload as many times as you wish. Previously uploaded files are overwritten. Only the last submission will be graded.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Feel free to ask me questions about homework submission (especially if you're not sure how or where to find the <code class="inline">/eclipse-workspace</code> directory) and I will be able to help you.</p>

            <h4>Setting Up Classkick</h4>
            If you have a Classkick account (possibly from a previous class that you took), then go <a href="https://app.classkick.com/account/login" target="_blank">here</a> to login. If you forgot your password, you can also click that link to try to recover your account. Once logged in, you will see a field on the top right corner where you can enter a Classkick code:
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/classkick-code.png" alt="ClasskickCode" title="Classkick Code Field" height="100">
            <br><br>
            Add the following homework Classkick code for the first homework: <code class="inline">RJV RIZ</code>. By doing this, you would have gained access to future homeworks (no need to always input the Classkick homework code). <br><br>

            If you do not have a Classkick account, create one <a href="https://app.classkick.com/#/signup/student" target="_blank">here</a>. First specify the following Classkick code: <code class="inline">RJV RIZ</code>. Then click on <code class="inline">Sign Up with Username/Email</code>. Create a username that contains your name; write the username and password down in your notebook so you wouldn't forget. By doing this, you would have gained access to future homeworks (no need to always input the Classkick homework code). <br><br>

            In both cases, it is expected that your account will be a "Portfolio" account instead of a "Basic" account. It is this that ensures that you do not need to input the Classkick homework code in order to receive future homeworks. I'll check this during the first day of classes to ensure everyone's account is correct. If it is not setup correctly, that is ok; I will let you know and we can fix it together.
            <hr>

            <h3>More Information About the Homeworks</h3>
            There are three status for Homeworks, which you should see on the first page of any homework posted on Classkick:
            <ul style="line-height:1.5;">
                <li><b>Homework open</b> - depicted by a yellow background, which means that the Homework is available to be edited/submitted to and the deadline has not yet passed.</li>
                <li><b>Grading in process</b> - depicted by an orange background, which means that the due date has already passed and your teacher is currently grading it; currently not editable</li>
                <li><b>Marked</b> - depicted by an green background, which means that your teacher has already graded it. Your teacher will make it editable again if in case you need to fix your corrections. </li>
            </ul>
            For each question of the Homework, it is either a 0/1. Then you will be graded with a Pass (50% or above) or Incomplete (below 50%) or No HW for not handing in the HW. Note that you also need to follow the instructions carefully to get a Pass. Your teacher will be providing feedback on Classkick.
