                To improve calculation skills with speed and accuracy, 5 to 10 minutes every class will be used to train for quick computation. Students are required to finish a set of basic math questions within a certain time limit. Consistent training like this will not only help students handle competitions better, it will also be critical for future excellence in more advanced math courses. <br><br>

                <i>The in-class quizzes will start on Class 5 (Feb 15th, 2025), and there will be a quiz weekly (except on Test days).</i>

                <h4>Homework Submission</h4>

                Please <span class="alert">access the Olympiads website</span> and <span class="alert">login using your Olympiads account</span> to download/print the homework. Once printed, please answer the homework; please write <span class="alert">clearly and legibly</span>. <br><br>

                <span class="alert">When submitting homework, all homework sheets must be stapled together with names and handed to your teacher when you come to class.</span> The homework solutions will be taken up in-class on the class that is due (i.e., teacher will collect Homework first, then will provide students will blank copies of the Homework where students can take notes of the solutions as the teacher takes up the homework solutions)<br><br>
                
                <b>Reminder</b>: <span class="alert">Make sure to download the correct homework!</span> For example, on the week after Class 01 before Class 02, you must download the file that has the <code class="inline">Class 01 Homework</code> filename (or something like that). <span class="alert">A common mistake that students make is that they download the wrong homework.</span> To align yourself on the dates, please refer to the course outline. <br><br>

                <hr>
<!-- 
                <h4>Feedback from Homeworks</h4>
        
                I hand back Homework graded one week after they are submitted. For each graded Homework, I tally the score. <span class="alert">If it is 80% and up, the grade is a "P". If it is less, then it is an "I". No submission means "Blank".</span> These are the three marks that I will be recording on my gradebook, which I forward to the school. The school will then forward to your parents as part of the report card. <br><br>

                Getting three "I"s means a "call-home". <span class="alert">It's ok to get an "I" in a Homework, as long as you fix your corrections.</span> Fixing your corrections allows your grade to increase, which could eventually change the "I" grade to a "P" grade. Once you get back a graded Homework that has an "I" grade, it is highly recommended to fix the corrections right away. See instructions below on the procedure to do it. <br><br>

                <hr> -->
<!-- 
                <h4>Fixing Corrections Instructions</h4>
                
                    <b>Important</b>: <span class="alert">If you get a "P", you do not need to fix your corrections</span> (actually you can but you do not need to hand it in because I will not grade that). <br><br>

                    For those who did not do the Homework yet (i.e. "Blank"), it is not counted as "fixing corrections". <br><br>

                    For those who got an "I", then here's how to fix your corrections. It may be different with another teacher but this is how Mr. Alix expects you to do it so everyone will be consistently the same. <span class="alert">Grab a piece of paper, then write your correct solutions and answers in that paper. Make sure to label appropriately. Then staple that sheet onto the back of your graded Homework. Then hand it to Mr. Alix.</span>  <br><br>

                    <span class="alert"><b>Note</b>: It still counts as an "I" if you do not follow this procedure for fixing corrections.</span> <br><br>

                <hr> -->

                <h4>Other Important Things to Keep in Mind While Doing the Homework</h4>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Late homeworks are accepted.</li>
                        <li>Make sure to show all your work. Getting the correct answer even without work will not get marks.</li>
                        <li>When solving Math problems, always end with a concluding sentence. It must have this "therefore" symbol: "&therefore;" and then followed by a <span class="alert">meaningful conclusion sentence</span>. For example, "&therefore; <i>The answer is three.</i>" is not meaningful if the question asks "<i>How many apples does Alice have?</i>". The better answer is: "&therefore; <i>Alice has three apples.</i>"</li>
                        <li>Do not forget to write your units in your final answer. Also, it must be the correct units. For example, if a square's side length is 6 metres, then its area is 36 sq. metres and not just 36 metres.</li>
                        <li>Box your final answer so I know what your answer is.</li>
                        <li>Proper math format is required.</li>
                    </ul>

                            <li>Boardwork - i.e., solving a question on the board</li>

                            <li>Class participation - i.e., answering a challenging question such as the warm-up</li>
                            <li>Homeworks/Tests - i.e., perfect score in a homework/tests</li>
                            <li>etc.</li>
                        </ul>

                    </li>
                    <li>The amount of MPs vary, and will also be announced.</li>
                    <li>MPs can be exchanged for prizes, such as candies, chocolates, or even score boosts in tests. List of prizes and their cost will be revealed later in the course (Class 4). Prizes can only be claimed on Classes 4, 8, 12, and 16 (Feb 26th, Mar 26th, Apr 23rd, and May 21st)</li>
