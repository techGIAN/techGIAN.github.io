        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>This course is designed as an introductory programming course specifically in the programming language Python. In this course, students will learn basic programming concepts, such as variables, operators, conditional statements, writing iterative programs, simple data structures (e.g., tuples, lists, sets, dictionaries), recursion, basic object-oriented programming, and software testing. By the end of the course, students will gain programming skills needed in various courses such as Computing Contest Courses and ICS 3U. <b>No prior programming experience needed.</b></p>
        <p><b>Course Prerequisites: </b> Grade 9 Math - Curriculum </p>
        <p class="alert"><i><b>Note: </b> Please contact your instructor if you have not completed the prerequisites for this course.</i> </p>

        <h4>Instructions for submission:</h4>
        <ol style="line-height:1.5;">
            <li>First create a folder with the following filename: <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-HWx</code>, where <code class="inline">x</code> is the HW number. So for example, I will name my folder as <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-HW1</code> for my first homework submission.</li>
            <li>Place all files that you would like to submit to this folder (i.e., copy-paste). For each file of your homework submission, you will submit either one of the following file types:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A <code class="inline">.py</code> file - this will be the most common file type that you will be submitting. Navigate to the <code class="inline">/PycharmProjects</code> directory in your system, then you will be able to find the file that your wish to submit in one of the project folders.</li>
                <li>A <code class="inline">.pdf</code> file - there are some homework exercises that does not necessarily require a code solution, but perhaps a math solution or an explanation from you. In such cases, you can create a document (i.e., Microsoft Word, Google Doc, etc.), type your answers there, and then export it to PDF format.</li>
                <li>A <code class="inline">.txt</code> file - I will be specifying if a simple txt file is needed for a specific homework submission</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once all files that you would like to submit are now in the folder, compress it using any of the zipping softwares. For Windows such as: <a href="https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0">WinRar</a>, <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a>, or <a href="https://www.winzip.com/en/">WinZip</a> (no need to install if your machine already has one). For Mac, a compression utility software is already built-in so no need to install (simply right click on the folder, then click on <code class="inline">Compress</code>).</li>
            <li>Upload the zipped folder to the following directory. Access it <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/SsDocX94Cck2n4A" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to upload as many times as you wish. Previously uploaded files are overwritten. Only the last submission will be graded.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Feel free to ask me questions about homework submission (especially if you're not sure how or where to find the <code class="inline">/PycharmProjects</code> directory) and I will be able to help you.</p>

        <h3>Accessing Grades</h3>
        <p>The gradebook will be updated every Wednesday and you can access your grades at anytime using your grade code. You can sign up for your grade code <a href="https://forms.gle/HZoYqqXqKpeyZCLs6" target="_blank">here</a> (you only need to do this once in this course), and you will receive the code within ~24-48 hours from the time that you signed up for it. This is what you will have to use to access your grade <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F61a0ixVtGn-SoKtUiRqZynpg74UPbbQwcXQDhWbpiI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. Make sure to read the instructions in this Google Sheet on how to use it.</p>

                Hope everyone is enjoying their weekend. I am delighted to see that many students have already submitted their homeworks ahead of the scheduled deadline. So great job and keep it up! I just would like to remind everyone that the file that you will submit must be <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-HW1.zip</code> (or possibly <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-HW1.rar</code>, just as long as it is a <i>compressed folder</i>). As an example, <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-HW1.zip</code>. Right after submitting, you will get a success message that the compressed folder was submitted. <span class="alert">Only the compressed files will be accepted and marked; all other files are automatically sent to the trash.</span> Remember that it is important to submit with the correct filename, because otherwise I will not be able to find your homework submission. If there are still uncertainties, please see me in-class on Monday regarding the submission.
