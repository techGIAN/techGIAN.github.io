        <h4>Instructions for submission:</h4>
        <ol style="line-height:1.5;">
            <li>First create a folder with the following filename: <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-HWx</code>, where <code class="inline">x</code> is the HW number. So for example, I will name my folder as <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-HW1</code> for my first homework submission.</li>
            <li>Place all files that you would like to submit to this folder (i.e., copy-paste). For each file of your homework submission, you will submit either one of the following file types:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A <code class="inline">.py</code> file - this will be the most common file type that you will be submitting. Navigate to the <code class="inline">/PycharmProjects</code> directory in your system, then you will be able to find the file that your wish to submit in one of the project folders.</li>
                <li>A <code class="inline">.pdf</code> file - there are some homework exercises that does not necessarily require a code solution, but perhaps a math solution or an explanation from you. In such cases, you can create a document (i.e., Microsoft Word, Google Doc, etc.), type your answers there, and then export it to PDF format.</li>
                <li>A <code class="inline">.txt</code> file - I will be specifying if a simple txt file is needed for a specific homework submission</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once all files that you would like to submit are now in the folder, compress it using any of the zipping softwares. For Windows such as: <a href="https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0">WinRar</a>, <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a>, or <a href="https://www.winzip.com/en/">WinZip</a> (no need to install if your machine already has one). For Mac, a compression utility software is already built-in so no need to install (simply right click on the folder, then click on <code class="inline">Compress</code>).</li>
            <li>Upload the zipped folder to the following directory. Access it <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/SsDocX94Cck2n4A" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to upload as many times as you wish. Previously uploaded files are overwritten. Only the last submission will be graded.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Feel free to ask me questions about homework submission (especially if you're not sure how or where to find the <code class="inline">/PycharmProjects</code> directory) and I will be able to help you.</p>

        <h3>Accessing Grades</h3>
        <p>The gradebook will be updated every Wednesday and you can access your grades at anytime using your grade code. You can sign up for your grade code <a href="https://forms.gle/HZoYqqXqKpeyZCLs6" target="_blank">here</a> (you only need to do this once in this course), and you will receive the code within ~24-48 hours from the time that you signed up for it. This is what you will have to use to access your grade <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F61a0ixVtGn-SoKtUiRqZynpg74UPbbQwcXQDhWbpiI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <li><b>Jul 29th, 2024: </b>
                Hello everyone! This webpage will undergo many changes, and I will also make announcements:
                <ol>
                    <li>Midterm grades are already posted in our grade book. Please check it out and supply it with your grade code to know your grade. There are two parts: Part A (out of 35) and B (out of 65). Midterm report cards have already been submitted to the school (which you expect to see either this week or next week); the grade I have reported is basically the sum of Part A and Part B, plus any bonus percentages that you have accumulated from the beginning of the course up until Jul 22nd class. Any unused bonus percentages gets carried over to the final exam. I will hand back your graded midterms today in class, plus any other feedbacks from Part B.</li>
                    <li>As we are nearing towards the end of this course (only less than a month away), I have decided to not only grade homeworks on Wednesdays but also grade homeworks as soon as I receive them. You should expect to receive your grade (view on gradebook) ~24-72 hours from the time that you uploaded your homework to OSSFiles. I still have some homeworks that have been submitted late last week, but I will get to marking them soon as I just have gotten extra busy this weekend marking midterms, so I do apologize.</li>
                    <li>I will be away starting Aug 5th (in the evening after our class), and won't be back until Aug 14th. Any emails that are sent after 4 PM of Aug 5th until Aug 14th would not be read/responded to until I get back. As such, any homeworks submitted during this time won't get marked and until I come back. A supply teacher for those days (Aug 8th and Aug 12th class) will take charge while I am away; please continue your hard work and dedication in-class as well as submitting homeworks.</li>
                    <li>Because I will be away for almost a week, I have decided to post all materials for the course up until Week 8, this includes Homeworks 5-7. Again, no changes to the due dates of the homeworks.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 24th, 2024: </b>
                Any homeworks that have been submitted up until Jul 23rd have already been graded. They should reflect now on the grade book (please supply it with your grade code), and it should also reflect on your upcoming report cards next week:
                <ul>
                    <li>Homework 1 grade is the grade in HW1 and HW2 of the report card.</li>
                    <li>Homework 2 grade is the grade in HW3 and HW4 of the report card.</li>
                    <li>Homework 3 grade is the grade in HW5 and HW6 of the report card.</li>
                    <li>Homework 4 grade is the grade in HW7 of the report card.</li>
                </ul>
                I'll see everyone tomorrow for the midterm. Please try to come on time; we'll spend the first 10-15 minutes taking up Homework 4 and any other last minute questions about the midterm that you may have.
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Here is the <a href="./codes/sample-midterm-py-sol.txt" target="_blank">solutions for the sample midterm</a>.</li>
                    <li>Also, here is the solutions to Homework 4: <a href="./codes/geometry.py" target="_blank">geoemtry.py</a> and <a href="./codes/geometry_main.py" target="_blank">geoemtry_main.py</a>; we will take up the solutions on Thurs before the midterm; the due date is still Jul 30th.</li>
                    <li>The in-class exercises solutions are also posted (see Topics and Resources section)</li>
                    <li>Here's the <a href="https://create.kahoot.it/share/python-midterm-review/46616392-382e-40dc-9236-c9d51767d773" target="_blank">Kahoot quiz questions</a> we did in-class yesterday with answers, to help prepare for the midterm.</li>
                    <li>Make sure you are able to know how to create a PyCharm Project and how to submit your midterm Part B to OSS Files. Instructions provided in the Other Resources section at the very bottom of the course webpage. Here is the submission link for the midterm: <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/DC5SmwDrgyzFLKM" target="_blank">https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/DC5SmwDrgyzFLKM</a></li>
                    <li>The first report cards might come in soon. I have handed in the grade book to the school last Wed (so any homework submissions after that might not have reflected in the first report card). The more important report card would be the next one, which will cover all homeworks we have so far + the midterm test grade. Again, Homework 1 is equivalent to Class 1 and 2 HW in the report card; Homework 2 is equivalent to Class 3 and 4 HW in the report card; Homework 3 is equivalent to Class 5 and 6 HW in the report card; Homework 4 is equivalent to Class 7 of HW in the report card. I'll do my best to try to get grades up ready early next week.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 21st, 2024: </b>
                My tips for studying for the midterm:
                <ul>
                    <li>Review each of the slides from Week 1 to 4. Make sure you not only know the concepts, but also able to do the in-class exercises independently.</li>
                    <li>Go over each of our Homeworks (and the solutions), make sure you are able to understand the solutions and able to do the questions yourself independently. (You can also redo them if you like!)</li>
                    <li>Try doing the sample midterm questions. Some of the questions there are Part A-type questions, and some are Part B-type questions. Timing yourself can also help, so that you are able to manage your time during the test (I will have a timer during the timer so that everyone knows how much time you have left).</li>
                    <li>It's good to prepare a new project already before the midterm begins to save time. For Part B of the test, you will initially be asked to create a new PyCharm project <code class="inline">Firstname-Lastname-Midterm</code> with three <code class="inline">.py</code> files: <code class="inline">q1.py</code>, <code class="inline">q2.py</code>, and <code class="inline">q3.py</code>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 21st, 2024: </b>
                Please refresh this page whenever you visit it, so that announcements could get loaded up. With regards to the homework, here are the solutions to Homework 2 Part A: <a href="./codes/hw2-py-sol/hw2_q1.py" target="_blank">hw2_q1.py</a>, <a href="./codes/hw2-py-sol/hw2_q2.py" target="_blank">hw2_q2.py</a>, <a href="./codes/hw2-py-sol/hw2_q3.py" target="_blank">hw2_q3.py</a>, <a href="./codes/hw2-py-sol/hw2_q4.py" target="_blank">hw2_q4.py</a>. I also thought that since the midterm is coming soon, then I might as well release Homework 3 solutions: <a href="./codes/hw3-py-sol/hw3_q1.py" target="_blank">hw3_q1.py</a>, <a href="./codes/hw3-py-sol/hw3_q2.py" target="_blank">hw3_q2.py</a>, <a href="./codes/hw3-py-sol/hw3_q3.py" target="_blank">hw3_q3.py</a>, <a href="./codes/hw3-py-sol/hw3_q4.py" target="_blank">hw3_q4.py</a>, <a href="./codes/hw3-py-sol/hw3_q5.py" target="_blank">hw3_q5.py</a>, <a href="./codes/hw3-py-sol/hw3_q6.py" target="_blank">hw3_q6.py</a>, <a href="./codes/hw3-py-sol/hw3_q7.py" target="_blank">hw3_q7.py</a>. But I trust that you will first do the Homework exercises before comparing your code/taking a look at my solutions. Anyways, there are no changes to the due date of Homework 3 (still due on Jul 23rd but I will take up the solutions tomorrow, Jul 22nd). Homework 4 has also been posted ahead of time in preparation for the midterm (due date is still Jul 30th and we take up the solutions on Thursday before the midterm test); anyways it is just a short homework.
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 21st, 2024: </b>
                The solutions to the in-class exercises and the handouts from Week 3 are now posted (see Topics and Resources section). Please try advanced reading on our topic on Monday -- Procedural Programming (see Week 4 resources in our Topics and Resources section). It's the last topic to be covered that is part of the upcoming Thursday midterm.
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 17th, 2024: </b>
                <span class="alert"><b>Important Announcement about the Upcoming Midterm Test:</b> This will happen next week Thursday, July 25th which will cover all material that we have learned in this course from Week 1 all the way up to Week 4. We'll talk about the <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/EMRjH9YgYozi6pk" target="_blank">full details</a> of this in-class tomorrow. For Part B of the test, you will initially be asked to create a new PyCharm project <code class="inline">Firstname-Lastname-Midterm</code> with three <code class="inline">.py</code> files: <code class="inline">q1.py</code>, <code class="inline">q2.py</code>, and <code class="inline">q3.py</code>. Here is a list of some <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/zToQn4k2jo6GBsD" target="_blank">sample midterm questions</a> (I don't have solutions; I'll post solutions here in the next few days only if I have time to make them). I can assure you that if you are able to solve these questions independently, you will have smooth sailing during the test.</span>
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 17th, 2024: </b>
                Please read the following <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/xbWTqAjgPmiPwMF" target="_blank">handout</a> in advance in preparation for tomorrow's class; we will take it up at the very end of tomorrow's class. Either print it or download the PDF file onto your local. I will also print it and provide copies for anyone who needs it. In addition, download this starter code <a href="./codes/restaurant.py" target="_blank">restaurant.py</a>.
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 17th, 2024: </b>
                Because we might not have enough time to do the things we need to do in our class tomorrow, I would not be able to cover solutions of Homework 2 Part B; I will instead post it <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/LWpbaJiMS95HQqm" target="_blank">here</a> (if you have questions about the solutions, please ask me during class). But I will still cover solutions of Homework 2 Part A at the beginning of class tomorrow.
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 17th, 2024: </b>
                For those who got a "P" for Homework 2, no need to resubmit corrections. For those who got an "I", make sure to submit your corrections (so that I could change your "I" to "P"). A common observation for Homework 2 is that some students still submit the wrong file format (don't submit <code class="inline">.py</code> files directly to the homework submission link; instead put them all in a folder then compress it and then submit that compressed folder to the homework submission link). Another common mistake is not naming the files correctly (specifically, I should see your name on the file; otherwise I would not know who submitted the homework since everybody uses the same homework submission link). Finally, there are still some students who are doing the wrong homework (will get an "I" on the report card). If you are not sure if you submitted correctly, feel free to resubmit or ask me for help.
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 17th, 2024: </b>
                Part A of Homework 2 has already been marked. Same as in Homework 1, each of the four Python programs is worth 1 pt each. So Part A is worth 4 points. Combined this with Part B that is worth 15 points, so Homework 2 is out of 19. To get a pass, you need to score 10/19 for this Homework; I <s>will post the grades later tonight when I get home</s> already posted the grades in our gradebook. I will also email <s>students individually if I have any concerns regarding their submitted homework</s> all students regarding homework feedback for HW 1 and HW 2; only resubmit the solutions to questions that have been marked incorrectly and zip as <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-HW2-corrections.zip</code>.
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 17th, 2024: </b>
                To those who have handed in their physical copy of Homework 2 Part B solutions and answers, they now have been graded and I will hand them back to you tomorrow in-class. Part B is worth 15 points: Question 5 is worth 3 points (1 pt for converting 37 to binary, 1 pt for converting -37 to binary, 1 pt for verfication); Question 6 is worth 12 points, with each equivalent to 4 points (2 pts for converting each of the two numbers to binaries, 1 pt for the binary arithmetic, and 1 pt for the verification).
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 16th, 2024: </b>
                <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/SD8g2ipRzPoCW9F" target="_blank">Here</a> are the solutions for yesterday's handout. Then the solutions for some of the in-class exercises are also posted (please see the Topics and Resources section). Next week's materials are also posted in the Topics and Resources section. Details about the midterm with some sample midterm questions coming up soon!

            <li><b>Jul 16th, 2024: </b>
                For Homework 2, I still see common mistakes from students who are doing the wrong homework, and those using the incorrect filename and file format (this was a recurring issue from Homework 1); I will send individual emails to students who have these issues. Remember, if you submit a file into this directory without your name on the filename, I won't know it's your work. If you're not sure or can't remember if you did it right, just resubmit it. I will start grading tomorrow. Homework 3 is now available.
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 12th, 2024: </b>
                For students who were not in class yesterday, I'll post the solutions to Homework 1: <a href="./codes/hw1-py-sol/hw1_q1.py" target="_blank">hw1_q1.py</a>, <a href="./codes/hw1-py-sol/hw1_q2.py" target="_blank">hw1_q2.py</a>, <a href="./codes/hw1-py-sol/hw1_q3.py" target="_blank">hw1_q3.py</a>, <a href="./codes/hw1-py-sol/hw1_q4.py" target="_blank">hw1_q4.py</a>, <a href="./codes/hw1-py-sol/hw1_q5.py" target="_blank">hw1_q5.py</a>

            <li><b>Jul 10th, 2024: </b>
                Hello everyone! Just an update regarding Homework 1. They now have been marked. So for those who have submitted anytime up until Jul 09th, you are able to see your grade in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F61a0ixVtGn-SoKtUiRqZynpg74UPbbQwcXQDhWbpiI/edit?gid=1323791518#gid=1323791518" target="_blank">gradebook</a>. You just have to type in your grade code on cell <code class="inline">A2</code> of the Google sheet (if you don't have a grade code yet, then sign up for one <a href="https://forms.gle/HZoYqqXqKpeyZCLs6" target="_blank">here</a>; you will be using this throughout the course so you only need to sign up once). Here are some information about the grading:
                <ul>
                    <li>The gradebook doesn't show any written feedback. So if you would like to get some comments from me, please send me an email. If you also want to know which questions you got right or wrong, please send me an email as well.</li>
                    <li>For each question, the grading scheme is either 1pt (if you get the right answer/result/output) or 0pt (otherwise) -- so total of 5/5 for this Homework 1. You get either a "P" (pass) or an "I" (incomplete) for this homework (for this course, a score above 50% is needed to get a "P"). If you get an "I", you are required to resubmit the corrected homework under the following filename: <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-HW1-corrections.zip</code> to the following <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/SsDocX94Cck2n4A" target="_blank">directory</a>. There is no deadline but you are expected to complete this as soon as possible. You can resubmit solutions to all questions but only the ones you didn't get correctly is what I would need. If you are not sure how to code the questions, it's ok because I will take up the solutions to the homework questions at the begininng of class tomorrow (Jul 11th).</li>
                    <li>This Homework 1 is equivalent to two class homeworks. So when you receive your first report cards, you (or your parents/guardians) might see that the HW1 and HW2 of the report card have the same grade, HW3 and HW 4 of that report card have the same grade, etc. (Basically HW1 and HW2 in that report card corresponds to our Homework 1 in this course webapge; HW3 and HW4 in that report card corresponds to Homework 2 in this course webpage, etc.)</li>
                    <li>A common observation that I see that some students do not submit with the correct filename and do not submit the correct file type. OSS Files sends wrong file types directly to the trash, and if you submit a file with the wrong filename, then I won't be able to locate your homework (it's like saying you handed in homework to the teacher without your name on it and the teacher won't know whose work it is).</li>
                    <li>Another thing I noticed is that some students are doing the homeworks that have been posted from the Olympiads website. Again, it is not updated -- so instead do the homeworks posted in this course webpage. This is the one for <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/FCcs7x8m8Er4Rt5" target="_blank">Homework 1</a> and for <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/zr27CYY5Weqzfig" target="_blank">Homework 2 (due on Jul 16th)</a> </li>
                    <li>If you have submitted past Jul 09th, it is ok to submit late (no penalty) but I just won't be able to grade it right away.</li>
                    <li>Should you have other questions with regards to the grading, please contact me via email.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 09th, 2024: </b>
                Many updates have been made, so I will break it down for you:
                <ul>
                    <li>Again, I do apologize for some mistake that had happened last night with the Kahoot quiz. I'll be sure to double check it before hosting another Kahoot quiz next time. So I decided that everyone who was 2nd place or lower will receive a +1% bonus for the midterm test.</li>
                    <li>Homework 1 is due today. If unable to submit Homework 1 today, that's ok -- I accept late homework (but try not to fall behind with homeworks!). For those who have submitted their Homework 1, thank you -- I will mark them (grades will be available by Wednesday/Thursday) and then we can take up the solutions in-class on Friday.</li>
                    <li>Solutions to the in-class exercises today have been posted already (see Topics and Resources section)</li>
                    <li>The second homework has already been posted. You should be able to answer questions from Part A already based on our lecture today. For Part B, I'll talk more about it this coming Friday. I'll also talk about the submission process for Part B on Friday since it is a little bit different than Homework 1 submission.</li>
                    <li>Week 3 materials already posted in our Topics and Resources section, for those who would like to do some advanced reading.</li>
                    <li>If you need an online Python compiler (for example, you require a quick access to Python on a computer that does not have Python/PyCharm), I highly recommend this from <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/" target="_blank">Programiz</a>. But it shouldn't replace the use of PyCharm during our in-class exercises, homeworks, and tests. I will also post this link in our Other Resources section. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 07th, 2024: </b>
                Hope everyone is enjoying their weekend. I am delighted to see that many students have already submitted their homeworks ahead of the scheduled deadline. So great job and keep it up! I just would like to remind everyone that the file that you will submit must be <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-HW1.zip</code> (or possibly <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-HW1.rar</code>, just as long as it is a <i>compressed folder</i>). As an example, <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-HW1.zip</code>. Right after submitting, you will get a success message that the compressed folder was submitted. <span class="alert">Only the compressed files will be accepted and marked; all other files are automatically sent to the trash.</span> Remember that it is important to submit with the correct filename, because otherwise I will not be able to find your homework submission. If there are still uncertainties, please see me in-class on Monday regarding the submission.
            </li>
            <li><b>Jul 05th, 2024: </b>
                I just posted solutions to some in-class exercises (see the Topics and Resources section). If you have questions on trying to run it, please contact me or let me know in class next week and I can help. Here is the solution to In-class exercise 7 (just a one line!):
                <pre class="line-numbers" style="width:40%;"><code class="language-python">print("2\t3\t5\t7\t11\t13\t17\t19\t23\t31")</code></pre>
