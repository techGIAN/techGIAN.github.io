        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>This course is designed as an introductory programming course specifically in the programming language Python. In this course, students will learn basic programming concepts, such as variables, operators, conditional statements, writing iterative programs, simple data structures (e.g., tuples, lists, sets, dictionaries), recursion, basic object-oriented programming, and software testing. By the end of the course, students will gain programming skills needed in various courses such as Computing Contest Courses and ICS 3U. <b>No prior programming experience needed.</b></p>
        <p><b>Course Prerequisites: </b> Grade 9 Math - Curriculum </p>
        <p class="alert"><i><b>Note: </b> Please contact your instructor if you have not completed the prerequisites for this course.</i> </p>

        <h3>Course Policies</h3>
        <ol style="line-height:1.5;">
            <li>This class requires that you have <span class="alert">stable internet connection</span>, as well as access to a <span class="alert">web camera</span> throughout the <i>duration of the lecture</i>. Please log in to Zoom ~10-15 minutes before the start of the class time.</li>
            <li>Load Java/Eclipse IDE before the class begins (see <a href="#otherRes">Other Resources</a> section below for more information about software installation). </li>
            <li>Phones (and other electronic devices aside from laptops) away during class! If you need to use them, ask your instructor for permission.</li>
            <li>The class is meant to be interactive. Participate in class discussions, and make sure to ask questions when you are not certain about something. Either type your question in the chatbox, OR click the "raise hand" button on your Zoom -- the instructor will call you and then you can feel free to unmute yourself and speak.</li>
            <li>Feel free to ask your instructor questions before the class starts, during the break(s), and after class. You can also contact your instructor anytime through email (see his contact at the header of this course webpage)</li>
            <li>There will be coding exercises throughout the lectures. You are expected to try working on these exercises (as I do not necessarily give out the solutions). Because it will be hard to check if everybody is doing the work, then I will trust that you are actually working on these exercises.</li>
            <li>There are homeworks expected to be submitted weekly. They will be released every Tuesdays, and will be due the following Tuesday. More information about Homework submission in the Homeworks section below.</li>
            <li>There will be a midterm test and a final exam for this course. More information will be provided closer to the dates.</li>
            <li>The use of any chatbots or AI such as ChatGPT is <span class="alert"><b>strongly discrouraged</b></span> in this course; and moreover, <span class="alert"><b>any work that is submitted that contains content of a generative AI is strictly not allowed</b></span>. <i>When caught, this incident will be reported to the school for disciplinary action.</i> </li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>

        <h3>Homework Submission</h3>
        <p>The school posts homework questions on the Meritus website, but the ones that I would like you to solve instead will be posted here (the questions are slightly modified so pay attention that you work on these questions instead). They will be posted here in this section every Tuesday (the first one will be posted on July 2nd, 2024 and is due next Tuesday on July 9th, 2024):</p>

        <h4>Instructions for submission:</h4>
        <ol style="line-height:1.5;">
            <li>First create a folder with the following filename: <code class="inline">firstname-lastname-HWx</code>, where <code class="inline">x</code> is the HW number. So for example, I will name my folder as <code class="inline">Gian-Alix-HW1</code> for my first homework submission.</li>
            <li>Place all files that you would like to submit to this folder (i.e., copy-paste). For each file of your homework submission, you will submit either one of the following file types:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A <code class="inline">.py</code> file - this will be the most common file type that you will be submitting. Navigate to the <code class="inline">/PycharmProjects</code> directory in your system, then you will be able to find the file that your wish to submit in one of the project folders.</li>
                <li>A <code class="inline">.pdf</code> file - there are some homework exercises that does not necessarily require a code solution, but perhaps a math solution or an explanation from you. In such cases, you can create a document (i.e., Microsoft Word, Google Doc, etc.), type your answers there, and then export it to PDF format.</li>
                <li>A <code class="inline">.txt</code> file - I will be specifying if a simple txt file is needed for a specific homework submission</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Once all files that you would like to submit are now in the folder, compress it using any of the zipping softwares. For Windows such as: <a href="https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0">WinRar</a>, <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a>, or <a href="https://www.winzip.com/en/">WinZip</a> (no need to install if your machine already has one). For Mac, a compression utility software is already built-in so no need to install (simply right click on the folder, then click on <code class="inline">Compress</code>).</li>
            <li>Upload the zipped folder to the following directory. Access it <a href="https://ossfiles.ca/index.php/s/SZAwXgmSDQ4dLNS" target="_blank">here</a>. Feel free to upload as many times as you wish. Previously uploaded files are overwritten. Only the last submission will be graded.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Feel free to ask me questions about homework submission (especially if you're not sure how or where to find the <code class="inline">/PycharmProjects</code> directory) and I will be able to help you.</p>
