    <h3> <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right" style="color:yellow"></i> <span class="subtitle">The Quadratic Formula</span> </h3>
    <p>
      In high school, we were taught how to solve quadratic equations. Quadratics are basically polynomials of degree 2, that is to say given a polynomial $ax^2+bx+c$ where $a\neq0$, then this is a polynomial of degree 2. And quadratic equations are those equations involving polynomials with degree 2. So for instance, this below is an example of a quadratic equation:
        $$2x^2 + 7x - 4 = 0$$
      because it is an equation that involves a polynomial with degree 2 in it, which happens to be $2x^2 + 7x - 4$. To solve this quadratic equation. The best way is to factor it and we can easily obtain the exact solutions (or roots if you will).
        $$(2x-1)(x+4) = 0$$
      As expected, we will get at most 2 solutions, which are:
        $$2x-1 = 0 \hspace{10mm} \text{and} \hspace{10mm} x+4 =0$$
      which gives $x = 1/2$ and $x=-4$. Voila!<br><br>

      The problem arises when the quadratic is no longer easy to be factorable (and at times are complex meaning its roots involve imaginary numbers). There is no feasible means to do the easy factoring and equating each term to 0 to obtain the roots. Luckily, the quadratic formula as what this page is about, happens to be our savior. But what is it actually and how we can derive it?<br><br>

      Let us begin with the quadratic form in general form:
        $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$
      It is assumed here that $a \neq 0$; otherwise we have a linear equation instead. We will only be dealing solutions for quadratic equations. What we'll do next is to subtract both sides of the equation by $c$.
        $$ax^2 + bx= -c$$
      We then divide the entire equation by $a$. Again, this is valid for quadratic equations whose value of $a$ is non-zero. So we need not worry about the division by zero problem.
        $$x^2 + \dfrac{b}{a}x = -\dfrac{c}{a}$$
      A method that may be familiar to you when graphing a parabola is <i>completing the square</i>. KhanAcademy has a great video discussing about it, if you are not too familiar about it or if you need to brush your skills. Click <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:quadratic-functions-equations/x2f8bb11595b61c86:completing-square-quadratics/v/solving-quadratic-equations-by-completing-the-square" target="_blank" style="color:red">here</a>. So we apply this completing the square method in our above equation to obtain:
        $$x^2 + \dfrac{b}{a}x + \dfrac{b^2}{4a^2}= -\dfrac{c}{a} + \dfrac{b^2}{4a^2}$$
      The LHS of the equation can be factored as it is recognized as a Perfect Square Trinomial. The RHS can be combined using a common denominator:
        $$\Bigg( x + \dfrac{b}{2a} \Bigg) ^2= \dfrac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}$$
      We recognize the numerator of the RHS to be the quadratic equation's discriminant, which is used to quickly determine the nature and number of roots the equation has. We reduce further by taking the square root of both sides and recognizing that either one of the sides of the equation has $\pm$ (take the RHS):
        $$x +  \dfrac{b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt{\dfrac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}}$$
      We subtract $-\dfrac{b}{2a}$ to both sides of the equation, simplify the radical and combine the terms to obtain the quadratic formula as follows:
        $$x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
      So we obtain two roots:
        $$x_1 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \hspace{10mm} \text{and} \hspace{10mm} x_2 = \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
      Imagine that the value of your discriminant $b^2-4ac=0$, then you only obtain one "repeated" root as $x_1=x_2$ and this is a real number. If $b^2-4ac>0$ though, then obviously we'll get 2 real solutions as $x_1 \neq x_2$. If the discriminant is negative though, then we'll get two complex (imaginary root) solutions and that they are distinct. Furthermore tney are complex conjugates of each other. For instance if $x_1$ happens to be $-2+3i$, then without having to use the formula of $x_2$, we can immediately obtain $x_2 = -2-3i$. Going back to the example $2x^2 + 7x - 4 = 0$, how many solutions are we expected to have and what is the nature? Well $a=2, b=7, c=-4$. Thus the discriminant is $b^2-4ac = 7^2 - 4(2)(-4) = 81 > 0$. As a result, we will have two real solutions. Using the quadratic formula, we get the following roots:
        $$x_1 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \dfrac{-7 + \sqrt{81}}{2(2)} = \dfrac{1}{2} \hspace{10mm} \text{and} \hspace{10mm} x_2 = \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \dfrac{-7 - \sqrt{81}}{2(2)} = -4$$
      You may use this mini calculator I have developed that uses the quadratic equation to compute for the roots of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. Just know that the calculator will not compute for anything whose value of $a$ is zero. Furthermore it can display how many roots can be obtained, their nature and it can also handle any complex roots. Note that blank fields are treated as 0 (hence you cannot leave the first field blank). To prevent overflows (as what will be discussed later on), I have limited the range of the numbers that you can enter in the fields. Let me know if you found a bug. <br><br>

      You can observe that both the factoring method and the use of quadratic formula are impressive methods to compute for the roots of a quadratic equation and both give the same results as what we have seen. Although factoring can be done easily and much faster than the quadratic formula, its main disadvtange is that quadratic polynomials which are not easily factorable cannot be done this way. The use of quadratic formula is more robust in a sense that this method will always work regardless... Or is it? <br><br>

      Unfortunately, there exists some coefficient triples $(a,b,c)$ where the quadratic formula is not reliable. Think about it. Although we disallow per se quadratics whose $a$ is zero due to it reducing to a linear equation, what happens when $a \rightarrow 0$ but still $a \neq 0$? Another formula might be applicable and would be much better. What happens if $b^2 >> 4ac$ (i.e. $4ac$ is  extremely relative small compared to $b^2$)? The notorious trouble that can be deduced here is that the roots of the quadratic equation will suffer a great loss of accuracy if we were to use this classical version of the Quadratic Formula. In the next section, we will introduce a better formula (can be derived from the Classical Version of the Quadratic Formula) to resolve the so called <i>instabilities</i> of the Quadratic Formula.

    <h3> <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right" style="color:yellow"></i> <span class="subtitle">The Numerical Way</span> </h3>
    <p>
      <span style="color:orange">Vieta's Formula.</span> Before preceeding to the numeric version of the Quadratic Formula, I first would like to present the Vieta's Formula. Whether or not you have heard of this formula (or maybe you know this already, but just not the name), then there is actually a great way to represent the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation in terms of the quadratic's coefficients. The Vieta's formula suggests that if the roots of a quadratic are $x_1$ and $x_2$, then:
        $$x_1 + x_2 = -\dfrac{b}{a} \hspace{10mm} \text{and} \hspace{10mm} x_1x_2 = \dfrac{c}{a}$$
      We can verify with an example, using the same quadratic as above $2x^2 + 7x -4 = 0$. We can easily verify that with our roots (using the factoring method, the classical quadratic formula or the mini calculator that I have developed), then:
        $$\dfrac{1}{2} + (-4) = -\dfrac{7}{2} \hspace{10mm} \text{and} \hspace{10mm} \dfrac{1}{2} \times -4 = -2$$
      Indeed, it is correct. We can generalize using:
        $$x_1 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \hspace{10mm} \text{and} \hspace{10mm} x_2 = \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
      It would not matter if $x_1$ had the plus or minus, similarly with $x_2$. Hence for the sum of the roots:
        $$x_1 + x_2 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} + \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = -\dfrac{b}{a}$$
      And the product of the roots:
        $$x_1x_2 = \Bigg( \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \Bigg) \Bigg( \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\Bigg) = \dfrac{(-b)^2 - (\sqrt{b^2-4ac})^2}{4a^2} = \dfrac{b^2 - (b^2-4ac)}{4a^2} = \dfrac{4ac}{4a^2} = \dfrac{c}{a}$$
      Thus, proving Vieta's formula correct. <br><br>

      So now I present a quadratic formula generator, provided the user inputs two roots. To make it as simple as possible, I put a limit on the max numbers you can put to avoid overflows. Also, you would not be able to submit without having to input anything. If you submitted one input only (either on the first or second field) and left the other field blank (which by the way does not recognize a 0), then it assumes that it only has one root. Also, click the checkbox if you mean to produce a quadratic equation with complex roots. In that case, the generator recognizes the first field as the real part of the solution and the second field as the imaginary part of the solution. Note that you get an error if you only submit one input and left the checkbox ticked. This is because for a quadratic equation (or any equation in general) with real coefficients, then you either get a set of purely real roots in return, OR you get some roots to be complex (however the number of complex roots you get is said to be even; since pairs of those complex roots when multiplied results into a real root). Note as well that the generated quadratics are not unique (in a sense that $x^2+2x+3=0$ is just the same as $2x^2+4x+6=0$. Let me know if you find bugs. <br><br>

      But why is this important? It seems as though using the Quadratic Formula has an instability, meaning to say that depending on the values of $(a, b, c)$, then either one of the roots is said to have lost accuracy (or significance). An in-depth explanation can be read below. We can simply obtain one of the roots using Quadratic Formula and apply the Vieta's formula to solve for the other root. <br><br>

      <span style="color:orange">Catastrophic Cancellation.</span> Another concept on Numerical Analysis I would like to present before preceeding is what is known as Catastrophic Cancellation. This phenomenon occurs when subtracting two values that are almost or nearly equal (totally not equal at all), and the result gives you less significant figures (or less precision if you will). PurpleMath has some great notes on significant digits if this is a fuzzy area to you, click <a href="https://www.purplemath.com/modules/rounding2.htm" target="_blank" style="color: red">here</a>. <br><br>

      Let's take a quick example of what Catastrophic Cancellation is. <br><br>

      Wolfram Mathworld has a list of a few beautiful approximations for the Euler's number; check it out <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/eApproximations.html" target="_blank" style="color: red">here</a>. I'll pick one of them to be
        $$e \approx 163^{32/163} = 2.71828936$$
      The actual value of $e$ correct to 10 digits is $e = 2.718281828$. That's what my simple scientific calculator can hold. Notice that by subtracting the exact value from the approximated value then getting the absolute value, we get $1.08 \times 10^{-7}$ and this has only 3 significant digits. However, each of our exact and approximated $e$ values began with 10 significant digits! This is problematic, i.e. catastrophic! There is no way that you are able bring back those lost significant figures! Apparently this trouble is very notorious and can cause hindrance in being able to solve some numerical problems, including the instability problem of the Quadratic Formula! <br><br>

      Though not all catastrophic cancellations provide a solution or a workaround, luckily the stable version of the Quadratic Formula is able to provide a fix for this issue. <br><br>

      <span style="color:orange">The Citardauq Formula.</span> I laughed at myself when I found out that Citardauq isn't really a name of a person who discovered this formula, but is simply the "Quadratic" spelled in reverse! But basically, this revised (still equivalent) formula is able to solve the instability of the Quadratic Formula. <br><br>

      But we might want to define first want stability and instability means, in the context of Numerical Analysis. A formula (or an algorithm) is said to be <i>stable</i> if miniminal changes to the initial data gives minimal changes to the final results, and it is <i>unstable</i> otherwise. It is also known that if only a certain initial data are stable while others being unstable, then we can characterize this as being <i>conditionally stable</i> (or <i>conditionally unstable</i> if you will). The Quadratic Formula works really well for values of $(a,b,c)$ that are said to be <i>rationally factorable</i>, which just means that the quadratic $ax^2+bx+c=0$ can be factored into $(x-x_1)(x-x_2)=0$ for some $x_1$ and $x_2$ quite nicely. These makes the quadratic formula to be stable. However, there are some values of $(a,b,c)$ that does not produce "accurate" results for $x_1$ and $x_2$. This is due to the loss of precision as discussed in catastrophic cancellation where the numerator of the quadratic formula $-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}$ (take plus if $b > 0$ and minus if $b < 0$) will be (nonzero) close to zero (i.e. the loss of significant digits). <br><br>

      To illustrate with an example, take the following quadratic equation:
        $$x^2 + 9999999999x - 0.0000002 = 0$$
      As an experiment, go back to the quadratic equation solver above that uses the classical Quadratic Formula and plug these values in. What results do you get for $x_1$ and $x_2$? Did you get these roots?
        $$x_1 = 0 \hspace{30mm} x_2 = -9999999999$$
      Is this even correct or is there a bug in the program? Clearly $x_1=0$ should not be a solution since plugging in this value to the above quadratic gives you $ - 0.0000002 = 0$, which is erroneous.  Similarly, plugging in $x_2$ would also give an erroenous result. So what is happening here? <br><br>

      We can approximate the quadratic
        $$f(x) = x^2 + 9999999999x - 0.0000002 \approx x^2 + 9999999999x$$
      due to $- 0.0000002$ being negligible, as it does not bring forth a signicant amount in the quadratic. If we do this, then our quadratic becomes:
        $$g(x) = x^2 + 9999999999x = 0$$
      and we can easily recognize this to be factorable, giving us the results as above. <br><br>

      Why does this happen though? Does the computer or the calculator just figure out that $- 0.0000002$ is very much negligible and decided to throw it out? Well, yes and no. Computers do not decide for themselves which is significant or not, and which to keep or throw away. As modern computers today are known to be <i>finite</i>, then it can hold only a limited amount of memory (by the way even though this calculator was programmed in a computer, I have treated it as if it was a simple scientific calculator with 10-floating point arithmetic). Unfortunately, there is no way of expressing a number such as $q = 0.00000000000000000000000000001$ (to be honest, I didn't count how many 0s are in there as I was just ramming on the '0' on my keyboard) in a scientific calculator (except if we used a scientific notation where this would have been $q = 1 \times 10^{-p}$ where $p$ is the number of decimal places there are after the decimal point of $q$; I seriously didn't count how many 0s are threw there but it was only to demonstrate a point, no pun intended).  And because of this "finite" property, then $a + q$ is merely equal to $a$ for some integer $a$ (at least in <i>computer arithmetic</i>). In real arithmetic though, $a + q$ since $a + q = a$ violates the properties of the fundamentals of arithmetic (i.e. no matter how small the number is then it still holds value). So I guess suppose you can say that $q = r$ in computer arithmetic and $q \approx r$ in real arithmetic, where
        $$r = 0.00000000000000000000000000002$$
      (I simply copied the value of $q$ and changed the last digit to 2 in case you're wondering). Thus in real arithmetic $f(x) \approx g(x)$ while in computer arithmetic $f(x) = g(x)$.<br><br>

      Ok well, what if we considered using the Quadratic Formula. Remember that it is conditionally stable since it is stable for certain values only, while it is unstable for others. If we considered the quadratic $f(x)=0$ from the above, the coefficient triples illustrate a good example that gives an unstable result. This is known as the <i>Instability of the Quadratic Formula</i>. Using the Quadratic Formula to obtain $x_2$, we have:
        $$x_2 = \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \dfrac{-9999999999 - \sqrt{9999999999^2 - 4(1)(- 0.0000002)}}{2(1)} = -999999999$$
      Computer arithmetic dictates that $- 4(1)(- 0.0000002)$ is negligibe compared to the magnitude of $9999999999x^2$. Hence such term is "dropped" as it gets "swallowed up" by the large number anyway. Thus $\sqrt{9999999999^2} = 9999999999$. And thus $-9999999999 - 9999999999 = -2(9999999999)$. Dividing the result by 2 gives you $-9999999999$ as $x_2$. The loss of accuracy here is not much since we added two values of great magnitudes and divided by 2, which just gives the same value of great magnitude. Sure there may be a "little loss" of accuracy due to the term drop that we applied due to computer arithmetic (real arithmetic does not allow it but we did for the purposes of making calculations quicker and for numerical analysis as well). But this is not the main issue here. The main issue is the root for $x_1$. We have seen that $x_1 = 0$ is not an acceptable root because it would only be a root if the quadratic $f(x)$ happens to be of the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx$ (i.e. $c = 0$). Since this is not the case, then $x = 0$ should not be a solution. This is due to the catastrophic cancellation mentioned earlier and one way to resolve the problem is to use Vieta's formula. Know that if one of either $x_1$ or $x_2$ produces a catastrophic root, then the other root should be stable. If $b > 0$ as the above, then $x_1$ is catastrophic; otherwise if $b < 0$ then $x_2$ is catastrophic. (What about if $b = 0$? Will there be any catastophic roots?) Because Vieta's formula suggests that the product of the roots $x_1x_x2 = c/a$, then simply get the stable root using the Quadratic Formula (say it's $x_2$ as per the above example) and then solve for $x_1$ using this Vieta's Formula. <br><br>

      Because $x_1$ uses an unstable formula that brings about catastrophic cancellation in the numerator, we can convert this formula to an alternative formula using the <i>Citardauq Formula</i>. To do this take the Quadratic Formula for $x_1$ and then rationalize the numerator as follows:
        $$x_1 = \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \cdot \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}} = \dfrac{2c}{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}$$
      Interestingly, whenever $x_2$ is the catastrophic root in the Quadratic form, its Citardauq Form is similar to the Citardauq Form of $x_1$, except we take the conjugate of its denominator:
        $$x_2 = \dfrac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \cdot \dfrac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}} = \dfrac{2c}{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}$$
      Catastrophe happens whenever $b^2 >> 4ac$, that is to say that the magnitude of $b^2$ overpowers that of the magnitude of $4ac$ greatly. It can be recognized that the number inside the square root is almost $\approx b^2$, which simplifies to $b$ after taking the square root. Indeed the numerator of the quadratic formula reduces to simply $-b \pm b$. If $b > 0$, then catastrophe happens at $+$ and if $b < 0$, then catastrophe happens when we take $-$. The workaround is to get the stable root normally using the Quadratic Formula and use the Citardauq Formula to get the unstable root (alternatively, use Vieta's Formula). So in our example above, using the $x_2 = -9999999999$ that we got from the Quadratic Formula, we can use the  Citardauq Formula to get $x_1$:
        $$x_1 = \dfrac{2c}{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}} = \dfrac{2(- 0.0000002)}{-9999999999 - \sqrt{9999999999^2 - 4(1)(- 0.0000002)}} = \dfrac{2(- 0.0000002)}{-2(9999999999)} = 2 \times 10^{-17} \neq 0$$
      Using the Vieta's formula instead, we have:
        $$x_1 = \dfrac{- 0.0000002}{(1)(-9999999999)} = 2 \times 10^{-17} \neq 0$$
      Notice both gave the same results and that did not resolve to being equal to 0. Hence, instability has been resolved. <br><br>

      If we were to input it in the Citardauq calculator below, do we expect to see varied results now compared to what we had initially had before in the classical calculator? Let me know for bugs. <br><br>

    <ul>
      <li class="customBulletRight"> The classical quadratic formula may seem straightforward and easy to use, convenient due to its robustness. However, certain coefficients on qudratics give a problem. This problem is known as the instability of the quadratic formula. We have seen an example of such.</li>
      <li class="customBulletRight"> As a result, only one the roots is said to be stable and the other being catastrophic, coined from the term "catastrophic cancellation". It is troublesome to solve problems numerically with this catastrophic issue due to the loss of accuracy (or precision), i.e. the loss of significant figures.</li>
      <li class="customBulletRight"> Each numerical problem have their own workarounds for solving the catastrophic problem. One suggestion is to use the classical Quadratic Formula to obtain the stable root, then apply Vieta's formula to solve for the unstable root. Alternatively, the Citardauq formula may be applied instead to obtain the catastrophic root.</li>
      <li class="customBulletRight">Note that the Citardauq Formula can be derived from the Quadratic Formula by rationalizing the numerator. It is also implied that if $x_1$ is stable and $x_2$ is unstable using the Quadratic Formula, then $x_1$ is unstable and $x_2$ is stable using the Citardauq Formula (or vice-versa). Hence we choose the appropriate formula to obtain the root $x_i$ through stable means.</li>
    </ul>
