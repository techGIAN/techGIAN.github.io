			Ok, so firstly before I begin, I just would like to say that I was able to publish a blog article yesterday (for the first time again after so long, I only had time recently), where I talked about some Conspiracy Theories (click <a href=“./ct-1.html” target=“_blank” style="color:#43962a">here</a> if you’re interested), which will be part 1 of so many more to come. But then I realized while I was posting it that I didn’t seem to give some life updates on what was going on. So before I give some LPT to back-to-school, I would like to update you with my life and what the hell is going on. If you’re not interested in hearing my life updates, it’s fine and you skip over to the next paragraph. But I think you still stick around. I mean I thought of creating a new post for it, but I say nah, I’ll merge it here. Ok well, the entire months of May to August were merely taking some summer courses to help me with the workload for the coming Fall and Winter terms (last ones by the way), which I think should be rewarding. I did one course called “Regression Analysis” (geeky) where in layman’s terms is that we would be building linear (made of straight lines) models given a set of data points. We worked on a small project where our data were automobiles and the goal was to estimate the prices given a set of factors; it was good! Another interesting course I took was “Advanced Data Structures” (yes, geeky again). It’s a theoretical Computer Science course where I studied several data structures that are used in theoretical computing such as trees, lists, heaps, and tables (there are more technical terms for these guys but these are as non-technical as I could think of). We study their special properties, the advantages and limitations, some algorithms related to them, and so forth. I learned a lot as it has a lot of practical applications! Ok well, another thing I’m working on is a special project supervised by a professor that uses space sample as the data. Not giving away too much because of confiential reasons and whatnot. But basically, similar to the project I mentioned earlier, our goal is to do some sort of prediction, but this time on the concentration of elements in rock samples. But the methods we are using are more complex than the ones I mentioned earlier. I’m also currently a TA for two courses; I’m liking the position but sometimes the work can be tedious especially when students are giving me a headache when it comes to marking. Those are my weekday activities. On weekends, me and my family try to do something to give ourselves some time to relax. These include going to an outlet or mall to go shopping, or perhaps to go out and eat for lunch, or to do the groceries. Well, many things to be done over the weekend. Ok well now, let’s get to talk about life pro tips especially that school’s about to start again. <br><br>

			So probably I should have called this the “Quarantine Edition”, similar to my Mother’s Day quarantine edition post from before. But I don’t really think it’s much of a quarantine anymore since a lot of people I see are just coming out of their houses and just running around and  enjoying the sun one last time. Alright, so I’d like to talk about 5 aspects of back-to-school, which I hope to cover not just for the continuing students but also to the first years. I’m thinking the audience is more for the post-scondary kiddos but I guess middle and high-schoolers could benefit too? (Or I guess if they do read this article in the future when they’re now in university or college?) Alright, so the 5 aspects are: tuition, classes, books, social life, and the “whatever” aspect. <br><br>

			I’d like to begin with tuition. So I imagine that you have decided where to go because of several factors such as tuition, program, location, and whatnot. I remember for myself that location was very much important to me. That included the proximity to my house, environment and ambiance, the nature, and whatnot. But tuition wasn’t really a major factor. From where I am, we could get school loans and start paying them little by little as soon as we graduate and get a full time job. It works in favor because I do not have to think of the burden of it. If you are continuing student, you might notice that tuition always increases every single year, just as how commodities would (well Economics 101 can explain that well for you). Anyhow, because education is very expensive, we must not waste it and must always take advantage of things it offers. You come to classes regularly and punctually, study well, go visit your professor’s office hours and always ask and annoy them with questions, anything free from the student government council should be utilized, and I guess any basic facitlity as well - oh and don’t forget to join clubs or organizations especially if they are served to you on a silver platter! The point is, tuition fees are costly, so make the most of your education experience! 	<br><br>

			Ok next is classes. Like I said, make sure you attend your classes regularly and punctually to make the most of your education. Professors are being paid regardless of whether or not you attend their classes since it’s already been paid for the moment you signed up for their classes. They would not care if you attend their classes or not (well, I guess some do and they even make up for a small percentage of your grade so always pay attention to what they say and sometimes you just gotta do it and suck it up; because the fact of the matter is, doing what they want is what makes them happy and entices them to give you better grades). So you have your program oir major; I guess those are the interesting ones. But those general education courses or GenEds are pretty important too. They make you a well-rounded person because you learn things that are not really taught in the major you are in. For example, Calculus 101 for the non-math kid, Music 101 for the non-music major, or Psychology 101 for the non-psychology major. Take advantage on this even though you might hate it and you will shine! <br><br>

			Next is books. For each class, there is probably a textbook that will be assigned for you to buy. Well, I mean you don’t have to buy it if you already have a copy. But acquiring the book can be done in many ways. One, you purchase it whether on Amazon, eBay, your school’s official bookstore or some other bookstore. Often the school’s bookstore is more expensive, so I recommend buying in Amazon personally. This textbook that I used for my Algorithms class, which costs like $200 in my school’s bookstore was on sale for only $60 on Amazon (plus an additional 10% off for the coupon). Amazon, especially when school is coming closer, has numerous sales on stuff that university and college goers need. I would say to take advantage of those! But don’t be too hasty when purchasing textbooks. The Professor would release a course syllabus or course outline that details that mandatory textbooks that you need. Only purchase those that are required (some may be supplementary that you might not even touch for the rest of term so don’t bother acquiring them). Books can be really expensive, on top of the tuition thing, so you really need to get only those that you need (and do make sure that you would be using them a lot!). Well, another way to get hands on the book is to purchase a used copy. The advantage to this is that it saves you money especially when the used copy is pretty much not even used or is close to the condition of a new book. Your school’s bookstore may sell them or you can always ask around especially those students who have previously taken the course - perhaps they may still have the book and are selling them for a cheaper price than the brand new one. But again, before buying wait for your professor’s instructions. Another way is to get the digital or PDF versions, which I think is a bit of a gray area. On one hand, you get the book for free (downloading onlin or perhaps the Professor can provide you with the PDF copy). But on the other is legality reasons. Some authors do not like digital copies of their books and don’t want them floating around the internet. So just a caution if in case you were deciding to get the electronic version, they can sue you. I myself like the physical hard copy as I could always bring it anywhere and it’s just easier to study on my end. The digital one is a bit harder as I still need a computer, phone or tablet to access the information on the book. But I guess it comes down to personal preference. <br><br>

			Ok social life and friends (and community life) is what I’ll talk about next. While it is important to keep your mind healthy and always be on top of the material of your courses, it is also important to nourish your social life. It’s good to always gain friends along the way (“no man is an island”). Join clubs and organizations that are of great interest to you. Do you have a hobby such as photography where you could potentially join a photography club? There could also be sports clubs or the varsity team such as the ball ones and perhaps dragonboat team. If computers is your game, then there’s always going to be an organization for that. You will gain many friends this way and be able to connect and network with so many people. Do you like to volunteer and get some leadership potential? You can always do so in so many different ways. You can even use this to your advtanage and include in your resume because hiring employers love seeing that you like to volunteer and have good community involvement. It gives them a good impression of your personality and your initiative towards work ethics. You can also use volunteering and community involvement in your scholarship’s application and personal statements!<br><br>

			The final aspect is the “whatever” aspect. This is more of the aspect where you are free to decide what you want to do or be especially after you graduate. Or could be basically anything that you want to do like a passion for instance over the years that you would be in university or college. Sometimes you gotta take a break from school since one can just feel easily burned out (like how I got burned out after 3 years of school with no break for any term and so I decided to work for eight months on an internship, no school). And whatever non-school related thing goes in here too. So I will leave it up to you to fill the corner piece in. Each one of use has his/her own “whatever” aspect and that it is for free. It can be school-related (even taking summer classes to catch up or to fast track is in this space) or not. It is there for you to decide.<br><br>

			I have so many more to share when it comes to life pro tips, especially when school’s about to make a comeback. In the future, I will write another school-related post that’s a life pro tip but not exactly like this. I’m thinking perhaps how one can save actual money while in college or university since it is going to be a tough and grueling journey ahead. Another thing I’d like to write up on is a conspiracy theory that I would be relating to our current education, but that can come next time. Until then , I bid you best of luck with school and I do hope it is something that you will enjoy and you would make the most out of! <br><br>
