			I have been a fan of listening to conspiracy theories, some of them I do belive, some I don’t. But regardless, I just enjoy reading and listening! Why? Well, I always like to entertain myself. And then there’s another part of me that likes to glimpse into the perspective of some other person. Some theories may be plausible, some may be just plain crazy. But I don’t think the exposition of truth and facts is the main value behind these theories but it’s more of the expression of one’s self and the ability to have one’s freedom of speech. This my friend is the first time I would be talking about conspiracies in my page. It would have several parts to it, but basically anything under the sun that’s related to Conspiracy Theories will be part of what I will be writing. Some theories you might have heard of, while others are my own personal ones. I would appreciate if you could share with me what you think about them and if you have your own theories as well! (Also disclaimer, please don’t sue me. These are all just for fun and expressing myself and own opinon. It is not intended to insult anybody!) <br><br>

			Firstly, I’d like to talk about aliens. They’re pretty much the first thing one could come to mind when it comes to Conspiracy Theories; and I guess pretty much some theories that suspect that the government has thousands and thousands of confidential information about these extraterrestrial creatures that are being hidden away in government-only facilities such as Area 51. Ok well, I need you to close your eyes for a sec (well maybe 10 seconds). Don’t worry you’ll still be alive when you open them. Ok, now imagine alien. What does it look like? What is it doing? How does it socialize and communicate with its kind? Did you imagine something like the one from the image of the main page of the blog? (In psychology, you call this framing - or perhaps something similar; that is when I initially presented you with an image or information can prove to be suggestive or persuasive in a later argument; in this case, when you saw that picture of the alien, you happen to picture at least first that imagery from what you saw). But that’s psychology, it’s not a conspiracy theory? Or is it? What if science (where psychology is a science of the mind/behavior) all along is a big conspiracy theory? Sure it presents some scientific theories but have you once ever thought about viewing it as a conspiracy? Ok, well  here’s an example. When an apple fell off a tree and hit Newton’s head, he said “Voila! I discovered gravity” (well he didn’t say it like that but basically he just gave an explanation for the apple to fall off the tree which is gravity). To us we think the answer is obvious now, gravity. But the question is, why did man just accept this reasoning or explanation? Probably he was credible? But probably, man isn’t just in content with something that cannot be explained. Ghosts and the supernatural are some other entities that are considered to be unexplained - and man is not satisfied until they get some concrete answers. Could it be that man’s curiosity is in fact a curse that man will suffer for the rest of humanity’s existence? It’s curiosity that nourishes science, and that sometimes there are exceptions to rules in science, but why is that? Do we just impose these exceptions in order for things to piece out and for chaos to be relinquished? So if the scientist Newton was one of those first few who had been on the curiosity pills , then this was indeed something from mankind already had ever since the beginning of time! <br><br>

			What I just talked about are some notions for curiosity and while I do think for myself that it’s good to be curious, I also think in some way that it’s a curse that can haunt us especially if we are not careful. I don’t know if that could be considered a conspiracy but “Curiosity just killed the cat!” (well metaphorically). Another thing that I would like to talk about, going back to the aliens again is that what if extra terrestrials (those creatures living outside the earth) are not the ones you imagine them to be? Ok firstly, let’s discuss their existence. Could there be actual life outside earth? Presently, only earth is the habitable planet. And we’ve learned from science is that well only earth can sustain life because of the reasources it has (such as water, plants, food, etc.) that are not present in other places outside earth. So could extraterrestrial forms even exist or could “foreigners” even inhabit some other planet? It’s something science can’t explain and that’s why I had to talk about “curiosity” (heck even I have some curiosity and have fears that it can take a toll on me some day). Sometimes cannot explain things and so they just leave it as “Science cannot explain it but it still continues its ongoing study and research of the matter”. Science fiction on the other hand does pretty well in showcasing extraterrestrial life. Well one of those aliens in those sci-fi shows or movies could potentially be the alien you imagined, yes? And there could be several manifestations of how directions portray what an alien looks like or how they behave? I myself imagine white creatures with big heads for their big brains, wearing goggles and basically ready abduct humans for their experiement. But what if they’re not like that? What if they’re just like us humans with no notion and limited understanding of the other species? What if they could be the ones who are more scared of us? Notice how there are more questions than answers? This is caused by the curiosity curse (talking about conspiracy theories or CT will just feed more fuel for a curiosity curse, which I will call CC from now on). Have you ever thought about living and co-existing with the foreigners someday? <br><br>

			I have talked about CC or curiosity curses and aliens today, but I’d like to talk about another one in my treasure chest. Another thing I’d like to talk about is the end of the world. There was a point in my life where I have thought that 2012 is the year the world will end, like there will be this massive apocalypse, I guess full of zombies maybe? And by that day ends, the world will cease to exist. I remember there was a movie like that, or something, I can’t remember. But ok, well, here we are with 2020 and still the world is still intact (I guess the coronavirus pandemic is making it less intact, but still it’s not yet the end?). So when is the actual apocalypse day? 21st century? Or perhaps year 3000? Who knows? How long can the world go on? What will futuristic earth look like? Even though we are in a technological world where technology is so advanced and things are  gotten done exponentially quick, I still thing we are long ways to go before that futuristic Earth setting you are thinking of. There’s just no way. Think about it, there has just been many problems here and there each country is facing (also corona is being a big jerk). And if some countries are at war, then there’s no peace, order and cooperation. All these sound so cliche but are just true. Political problems, financial problems, crimes, military problems, these all add up. It will be hard to get into the goal to build a futuristic earth, but I’m not saying it’s impossible. It is still possible but just not anytime soon. All I’m saying is that even with our technological advancement, any major growth would just be a tiny percentage of the progress towards the main ultimate goal. But would our earth turn futuristic first, or will earth cease first? How will earth cease to exist? Many ways. Nuclear war, a plague that’s much worse than the Bubonic plague, or basically an entire destruction to Mother Nature (but that’s obvious). Oh and by the way, I had too look up if it is possible for Earth to be sucked by a black hole; and good thing no because apparently there had to be a star three times larger than the sun within our solar system that could cause this, but good thing no. Anyway, we don’t really know if earth would end soon (maybe tomorrow or next year or some other time). So could we say the lifeline of earth is infinite? It’s a paradox. While we think that earth can be obliterated (even little by little due to the misuse and destruction of the environment), it’s still possible for the earth to be kept sustained and to be as is even for centuries or milliions of years or perhaps have an infinite lifeline (given that we all do our part to take care of Mother Earth). So what’s the conspiracy here? Well, it’s earth’s time life line. It’s a paradox. We may be nearing its death but it seems to feel like it’s entire lifeline has only been spent for just 1% of it, or perhaps even less than that due to its unbounded capacity for its lifeline. <br><br>

			Ok well to end it here, I’d like to summarize the things I talked about today. And I will do this for any conspiracy theory blog I write. So firstly, I made an introduction of how I will write CTs. Then I come to talk about CC or curiosity’s curse, and I used aliens and science as a main motivation for this curse that man will bear for the rest of one’s life. I talked more about extraterrestrial life where it may be possible that these aliens are not what we expect them to be; but then I was left myself with just more questions than answers as seen. And this brings back the CC that I was talking about. And then finally, I came to talk about the earth and its paradoxical lifeline - that it could either have a long infinite life or that maybe tomorrow is doomsday (let’s hope not)! <br><br>

			By the way, my posts are becoming fewer and fewer. I have been really busy over the summer and got a lot under my plate planned for the fall. I’d like to make a life update on my next write-up. Also since I am now working on writing about Conspiracy Theories (CT) from then on, I will try to release one every month (or two months). If I don’t release one, then it means I might not be existing anymore (hope not; there were theories behind this to attempt to silence the theorists). Ok, well go fo max of 4 months, then that’s the time. <br><br>
