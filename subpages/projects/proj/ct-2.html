			Ok, part 1 of my Conspiracy Theories series wasn’t that too exciting. I just introduced you to the conspiracy theories themselves and how I feel about them. Then talked a bit about things here and there. One was about the curse of curiosity - which was innate in man. As in each of us tends to have more questions than answers, but this could be seen as more of a conspiracy on science where science feeds on curiosity. But now that I think about it, curiosity can also be seen as a philosophy that is innate on man after all, but not as a curse. I also got to talk a little buit about aliens, where they might not be how we pictured them to be, because I believe that we tend to get the notion of those aliens and how they look like based on sci-fi media. And I think that this is a big manipulation move, seeing that man is this dense and that we can easily get tricked. And finally, I talked about how the earth’s lifeline is a paradox. It’s infinite because we don’t know when is it ending, but it is also limited at the same time. Now you might think these are not really conspiracy theories, but to me or to some other person they may be considered as CT. I guess my point is, a theory may be considered a CT but is subjective to the perspective of the user You can believe so or you don’t. I would talk about them regardless. Note that before I begin each CT article, I would summarize what I have talked about previously, and then in the end summarize what was talked about. <br><br>

			So today, I’ll be talking about three things. One is about money, another is about the Bermuda Traingle, and the other being about the poison around us. Let’s start with money. Think about the last time you spent your money on something, whatever it is. Did you ever think about its worth? Did you ever think it was worthy? Does it even have value? Well, my friend. That’s the theory. Money doesn’t have value at all, which I guess is a paradox itself. You need money to buy things that you want and need. But having money and not spending it (but you gotta save it right?) does not make it valuable. Even if you have millions of dollars but you’re not spending them, and leaving them to rot, then they have no value. Money originated long time ago and the first form of currency was in the form of goods, i.e. trading. In order to get something that you want (or need), you must possess something of “equivalent value” and then trade it, hoping it will be a successful trade. The problem here is: (1) there is no notion of equivalency (i.e. how could one sack of rice equal 10 cobs of corn for example?), (2) who decides legitimate equivalency (well I guess amongst themselves since there wasn’t any notion of law back then?), (3) one is unable to judge whether he is at the upper hand or at the disadvantage (again, unfariness), (4) you need to have something to get something, but how do you acquire that something if you originally begin with nothing? (5) both parties have to agree (i.e if only one person wants the trade and the other doesn’t, it’s not gonna work out - similar to one-sided love). Ok, so I guess this is the motivation for how and why (or where) our currency came from. But this goes back to the question, “What is the value of money?” How much is a $1 bill worth? Well, depends on currency I suppose. So there is some intrinsic value I guess? But we only see it when we acquire things that we need and want using the money. It doesn’t have actual value if it’s not spend. So in order to see this actual value, you have  to spend a lot of your money, but doing so affects your budget and earnings, which does not show good value at all. With this paradox in mind, is money that valuable after all? Remember, money can’t buy you happiness (true happiness) that is. <br><br>

			Now I’d like to talk about the Bermuda Triangle. Click <a href=“https://www.theweek.co.uk/95557/bermuda-triangle-five-theories-on-the-mysterious-disappearances” target=“_blank”>here</a> if you wish to learn mnore. Anyways, this specific region is located between Bermuda (north), Florida (west), and Puerto Rico (south). And there have been many stories being told about many ships and planes disappearing without trace when they enter this zone. In fact, around 4 planes and 20 boats each year have gone missing when they get caught up in the dangerous waters. Both scientists and conspiracy theories alike have thought of theories on how this phenomenon can be explained. There were theories on dangerous water waves called <i>rouge waves</i>, explosive underwater volcanoes, methane bubbles underneath the crust of the seafloor, magnetic compass malfunctions, and even aliens that abduct the ships and planes (including the humans) for experiment (and the triangle is simply a portal or a gateway towards the alien realm). It is also theorized that the Lost City of Atlantis could possibly exist underneath the waters of the Bermuda Triangle (I would write a whole theory about Atlantis some other time). Some do not believe any of these and just left it at “probably just a coincidence”. I myself believe that it could be a combination of these things. Perhaps there were dangerous storms that destroy the ships or planes that get sucked in by the Bermuda, and that the inhabitants of Atlantis abducts these people on board. Any debris of the destroyed ships or planes get cleaned by the underwater healing effects (or perhaps the power of rthe kings and queens of Atlantis). The abducted humans have then been forced to be citizens of Atlantis while being manipulated, controlled and brainwashed for them to never return to the surface and to keep the secrets of Atlantis safe. Of course, this sounds hysterical but nothing is a possiblity, correct? But what if the secrets of the Bermuda is protected by a secret global government organization that attempts to create mystery into the minds of people? And here we ago again with the curse of curiosity ya-di-ya-da… <br><br>

			Finally, I’ll talk about poison. Well,  I guess metaphorically speaking. The earth that we live in is actually a poison. So we’re standing on earth and we are “poisoned”. The food that we’re eating is poisoned. Pop culture is poison. Basically anything that you can see, feel, hear, taste and smell is poison. By “poison”, I mean metaphorically that it attempts to manipulate you, make you addictive and addicted, and to basically give harm. It doesn’t really kill all of a sudden (well, I mean there are some poisons that are seriiously deadly, so I guess there are levels to poison’s deadly states). Why do you ever think man is not immortal? We are slowly being killed throught these poisons. The medications, even the air, are poisons. It is literally impossible to get rid of this poison. Whether you’re on earth or somewhere else outside earth is poisonous. You can’t even survive outside earth since it’s inhabitable, so that one has an extreme poison. On earth, depending on your situation and your current circumstances, the poison may not be dire. Is there a cure? No. Because if there was, it would still be a poison. Because the conspiracy here is that everything around us is poisonous, and there is no escape. It is little by little killing us all. To other human beings or any life of the form, brings toxic. Hence poisonous on a metaphoric, figurative or even literal level. And then the poisons that are actually poisons such a rat killer or a poison ivy. There is no cure (but maybe the government wants you to think otherwise?). And we are oblivious to this fact (or theory) because we hate the notion of manipulation, harm, and poison. <br><br>

			To end this, I’d summarize some things I have talked about today. Firstly, I talked about money which has a paradocial notion of value. Secondly, I talked about some explanations on the whereabout for boats and planes that travel through the Bermuda Triangle. Many have some theories, but I discussed my own theory which is basically a combination of what has already been theorized. Finally, I talked about the poison around us - that exists everywhere and that there is no cure for it. Man’s limited lifeline is an example that I have given of why is the case. Next time, I would talk about three more theories that are worth talking about. For now, I will sign off - and if you haven’t read through my Conspiracy Theories Part 1, feel free to click <a href="./ct-1.html" target="_blank">here</a>! <br><br>
