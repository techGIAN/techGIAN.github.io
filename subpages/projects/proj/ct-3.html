			Luckily, I am able to squeeze in 30 minutes of my time talking about another Conspiracy Theory. I’m pretty much swamped with work over the week (and probably next week too). Today’s my off (which is good). I got myself a new magic keyboard and a new magic trackpad, which is quite handy -especially I’m retiring my macbook’s keyboard and trackpad (considering I’m using a stand for my macbook pro now). Anyways enough about me, just to remind you of what we have talked about last time. It was about the paradoxical value of money, Bermuda Triangle conspiracies, and the poison that’s around us. Look over <a href=“./ct-2.html” target=“_blank”>here</a> for the story about it. Anyways, today let’s talk about the following: (1) The Star of Our Own World Theory, (2) The Dollarama Marketing Ploy, and (3) The Cancer Cure Theory.<br><br>

			Ok so since the first one (The Star of Our Own World Theory) is pretty much a personal favorite of mine that I sort of believe (well most to all of these conspiracy theories that I talk about I believe; otherwise why on earth would I be talking about them). For this one, I decided to leave it for last (save the best for last) for today’s. I’ll start from the bottom and go all the way to the top. And it’s about the Cancer Cure Theory. Well for this one, you might have heard about this before (or maybe not?). But we all know how cancer is incurable (i.e. not curable). Ok, well not entirely true as we have seen many survivors of cancer (regardless of what type of cancer; such as lung cancer, colon cancer, skin cancer, etc.). But the point is, it is not easy to cure once diagnosed (and for higher stages, it’s really harder to cure). It’s a pretty much fatal disease. But why is there no “cure” for it? Denote this C (for cure). Why do we have no C for it until now despite this has been a sickness for several years, decades and centuries already? By the way, by definition of C - I mean that C is a pill, a medicine, or whatever drug that one takes in order to feel instantly well. Take for instance cough, you only need a cough syrup so that it goes away (most of the time;  or at least an effective treatment). And what about for headaches? What’s the C for this? Well, there’s Tylenol for example which could serve as the C for headaches? And what about cancer? What’s that ultimate C that utimately takes the disease away from someone suffering from it? Is there even a vaccine for such? Ok, well, the theory is that there is actually a cure for cancer - yes a C for cancer! Except, it is hidden from the public. The medical and pharmaceutical experts are hiding this because when this special drug comes out, this will cause a huge downfall on the pharmaceutical industry. Patients suffering from cancer need not buy and purchase many of those pills and drugs. This causes this industry to lose millions and millions of money once word has gone out that there is a C for cancer! Furthermore, the average cost of this C for cancer is very cheap in the market just because of the fact that the ingredients needed to make the drug is very cheap and can be found in nature easily due to their abundance. So the secret recipe for the C of cancer is pretty much locked up and hideen from society, all because the medical industry is pretty much protecting their industry’s huge economical impact.<br><br>

			Well, so that’s the theory on Cancer Cure - but who knows how true this may be? But what I’d like to talk about next is something that is most likely more believable. But this could be more of a markerting strategy, a tactic. But still hear me out. This is about the ploy of Dollarama (or basically dollar stores). Not sure how you call these dollar stores, but that’s how it’s called in where I live. They’re pretty much the same, same tactic, same strategy, same marketing ploy. Actually, I would discuss many of their ploys. Firstly, when they say <i>”All their items are worth $1.”</i>, then that’s a lie. Well from where I live, it’s not just $1, but it will be $1.13 (because of taxes). So the answer is no, they’re not just $1, but more than that! And there are also other items that are even more than the $1, could be $1.25, $1.50, $2, or sometimes even $3 or $4 - so again they lied when they said that everything in the store is only $1 (and of course don’t forget the taxes). The quality of their products is just cheap and trash (just a personal opinion; well to be fair, what do you expect for products that cost less than $5?). But here’s the real marketing ploy here. If you think that shopping at Dollarama is a good idea, then I disagree with you my friend. At first grabbing a couple of “$1 items” and putting it in a “basket” (not the cart) and saying “I haven’t really gotten much and that there’s only a few items that cost $1”, well guess again. It’s pretty much that all those items might total to $30 already (or even more!). You won’t really notice it but the cost stacks up quite quickly, especially since the products are not flat $1.00. This means that for a $30 budget, you won’t get 30 items at the dollar store just because of the fact that the minimum cost item there is $1.00 + the tax, around 13 cents addition. Using a calculator, you’d be able to get at most 26 items only from the store and that’s assuming all the items in your basket happened to be $1 tagged. And this gets pretty awful with a cart. You won’t feel that you have shopped enough until you fill that bin and you would have that mindset “It’s just $1 each” is disastrous. I’m not here to trash talk on Dollarama but I see the marketing strategy, which is actually good. But as a consumer, one must know about the marketing tactics of the company. To be honest I like buying in Dollarama too. I might cover in the future about the marketing ploys of Apple, also another store where I like to shop, and I’m pretty sure my Mac and iPad are already watching and listening to me (for another theory next time).<br><br>

			Ok now it’s time for my favorite theory of the day: The Star of  Our Own World Theory. This theory is actually inspired by <a href=“https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/“ target=“_blank”>The Truman Show</a>, where basically the main character found himself to be watched by in the end of the show. And that’s pretty much us right now. Each of us in our everyday daily lives are playing as the main character of our own personal show. For example, I could be running my own the <i>Gian Show</i>. I am the star of this show and I am the main character of my own show. Anybody close to me such as my close relatives, my family and even circle of friends participate to be the secondary cast of my show. And anybody else are sort of minor chracters or the extras. So let’s talk about the audience of this show (or play even). It’s most likely the government. There is always a camera looking and watching us in our every move. I have some theories about how the government have most likely attached some sort of camera or chip on us which I’d like to talk about some other time. Another camera is most likely gonna be our phones. They would listen to us (such as how Faccebook does, for another theory next time). Our phones tend to see us and our every move (through the cameras) - even the Face Id in iPhones pretty much has some involvement on this. So anyways, the government may seem to have access to these data. And they would be the perfect audience for our own world theory. But at the same time, they’re also the ones taking the shots in this show. They are the same time the director, the producer and even the script writer. They shape our lifestyle and the choices and decisions we make (i.e. why do you think we fall for the ads that we keep seeing?). They also have dictation of the status quo, what is the norm, the society, etc. These are parameters that they can toggle and this is what they change for each and everyone of us - so that each one of us is unique and that each show that exists in the world tends to be different. For what purpose? Would it be possible that they are concocting or formulating the perfect individual for some devious plot that can cause harm to humanity, briing them advantage? Could they be working with the aliens? Or is there something more behind this?

			Anyways, I will end it here and I would leave it up to you to believe (or not) on the validity of these theories. So just to recap, today we talked about the cancer theory, the dollarama theory, and the star of our own world theory. If you like reading more of my conspiracy theories, have a read on my <a href=“./ct-1.html” target=“_blank”>Part 1</a> and my <a href=“./ct-2.html” target=“_blank”>Part 2</a>. Just a disclaimer; since I don’t wish to be sued (or killed for that matter lmao), these conspiracy theories that I write and talk about are merely for fun and entertainment purposes only. You may choose to believe in them or not, but in no way is it to be used to cause harm to anybody else. Until next time, bye!<br><br>
