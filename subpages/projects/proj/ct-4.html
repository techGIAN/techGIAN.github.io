			This will be the final installment of my Conspiracy Theory series for the year and I will resume again with Part 5 in early January. For now, we will talk about three things. One is about the hidden truth in news stories. Secondly is about subliminal messaging, and third is about living in a simulated world.<br><br>

			Ok so let's begin with hidden truth in news stories. It could be news articles in magazines, newspapers, or on TV. But it could also be possibly verbal news through word of mouth. Or perhaps news in the company you're working for. So my theory is that for each news out there, there is a component, or a part, or portion, or piece that is hidden or is missing. So sort of like a white lie. You know how when you were young and you had to tell your mom that you have to go to a friend's house to do something important like an assignment; but in the actuallity you go there to do some studying 10% of the time, and playing video games 90% of the time. You are not wrong about doing an assignment and studying, you are in fact right about it. But however, you did say something incomplete - a white lie. You hid from her another truth, which is about playing. So you get what I mean. And now, every news I believe then has this aspect regardless of motivation may it be good or bad. In the example I gave, the motivation is simply entertainment. Here's another example, picture a news video on TV that reports more than 20 casualties in a shooting incident in some place that's known to be a great peaceful place to live. But what if there's a total of 50 casualties in all after all? It is true that there's more than 20, i.e. 50 > 20. But they did not report the actual figure of 50. Or they could have mentioned "nearly 50" or "half a hundred" to report the actual number. Of course, the motivation here is to ensure people worry less when they hear the news, but at the same time wanted outsiders to know that their place really is peaceful and it could have been by chance or coincidence that their incident just happened. This could also be the same case for CoViD-19, when the number of infected people is not being reported correctly (I'll do theories on this for when this pandemic is all over). Another example would be when a company reports to their employees and staff that someone has configured their system company settings and that they are still trying to figure out who. Then it turns out that it's one of the admins themselves who have done it, and to hide this mistake, they are saying that they are trying to figure out who but they already know it's one of the higher ups. Clearly, they are performing damage control and protecting the members of the board for their incompetency. So to summarize again, there must be some hidden truth that is bleak enough that is always hidden in news or in messages that they are always being construed and hidden and unrevealing to sweep it off the rug or to simply prove that there is nothing wrong or perhaps as a way of damage control. There is always a motivation for these hidden underlying truths. <br><br>

			The next is subliminal messaging and I'm pretty sure everyone is familiar with it. In fact, this may not be a conspiracy theory but a fact perhaps? It is already being studied in pscyhology (I do remember studying this for my PSYCH 101 class) and it is even a strategy and tactic used in Marketing. Basically, this is a process of influencing or sending messages to the human mind with no to low conscious or awareness of what messages are brought. But it somehow gets to you. Here is an example. Why do you think there are preview screenings before the start of a movie in a theatre? These screenings are in the form/combination of ads, movie trailers, etc. Even shows a clip or a picture of a popcorn or hotdog or cola and the next thing you know it, you are already buying these snacks from the concession and later on eating them in the theatre. And what about those movie trailers? Clearly, those trailers are the coming-soon movies (or sometimes even movies that will be in one years time) but they are similar in flavor (could be similar plot or genre to the one you are about to watch), and so you see these movies and they are subliminally suggestive in recommending you to come back to the theatres next time to watch them as soon as they are available. They are enticing you to come back to watch and pay again. You will be most likely be attracted to those because you are interested in a movie you're about to see. That's another subliminal message there. If you happen to see a Facebook text post, with a combination of lowercase and smallercase letters, you are more likely to read between the lines of looking at the letter in caps and seeing if there's a hidden message behind it. That's because human minds are trained to read words or phrases or sentences that have same case throughout (i.e. all caps, or all lowercase, or only the first letter of the sentence plus first letter of proper nouns are capitalized). So it's not farfetched anymore. Subliminal messages are actually a thing now.<br><br>

			Lastly! Living in a simulated world theory. Or possibly in a virtual game? Life isn't really a game, or is it? What if our whole lives, we are playing as our own characters, and in the VR or AR sense? What if when we are born here in this world is the same as how we just started playing the game? For any RPG game I have played ever since I was a kid, when you start playing a game, you always begin at Level 1 (or 0)? And whenever you do some tasks or quests or fight monsters, you receive experience, which accumulates allowing you to level up. In this case, what if those tasks or quests are the goals that we want to achieve and fighting monsters are basically facing fears and challenges in life? And by doing so, we gain experience for the betterment of ourselves. I guess the only difference would be that in an RPG game, if you don't play that game or leave the account still or you do not fight monsters or do quests, you won't gain experience or won't level up. Here it might be the same thing. But it could also translate for time and age to progress for you to level up (eg. level is age). So you only need to undergo 365 days at least to level up. And regardless of what you do, you'll have to wait. And then death in RPG is when our hitpoints or HP goes down to 0 and then we can respawn. Here, when we lose our life, there is no respawning. But other people believe in reincarnation, which could be the translation of respawning, but it's not really respawning as reincarnation resets everything back to square one. So what do you think? Could we be living in a simulated world after all, something that perhaps the government does not want us to know the real truth? Again, this brings us to the curiosity curse (CC) from our Part 1 of Conspiracy Theories. <br><br>


			To wrap the year up with the fourth part of the Conspiracy Theory series, we have talked about hidden truths in news, subliminal messaging and simulated world theory. If you like reading more of my conspiracy theories, have a read on my <a href=“./ct-1.html” target=“_blank”>Part 1</a>, my <a href=“./ct-2.html” target=“_blank”>Part 2</a>, and my <a href=“./ct-3.html” target=“_blank”>Part 3</a>. Just a disclaimer; since I don’t wish to be sued (or killed for that matter lmao), these conspiracy theories that I write and talk about are merely for fun and entertainment purposes only. You may choose to believe in them or not, but in no way is it to be used to cause harm to anybody else. Happy new year's again everyone! Until next time, bye!<br><br>
