			Let’s talking about my first failure. Actually, I failed many times in my life. And for different contexts. But let’s focus on my first failure on a test or midterm in university. I was pretty much an excellent student all throughout my childhood days, even up until now. However, one of the subjects that I was taking, which was literature was not pretty much my strong. It’s not my cup of tea. But ok, let’s see the context first. One week before my midterm, I caught the flu and I was bedridden for an entire week. It was a very horrible terrible flu wherein I just got sick then I got fine again and then sick again. So I was sick all throughout the week and cannot have time to study for my midterms and tests. But I wrote it anyway. The test was a little funky in a sense. Because the professor would give us the list of (essay) questions beforehand, roughly a week before. And then we have two choices: (1) is to write the test in-class (i.e. write the answers to the essay questions in-class), or (2) do it beforehand, type and print and then submit. Clearly, (2) was a better option since we can write it before class starts and we can just hand it in and leave. Well, here’s the catch though. There’s four essay questions, and the professor will roll a fair die at the beginning of the class during the in-class test. Getting a 1 means we will be answering essay question 1, same goes for essay  questions 2,3,4. If we do get a 5, we are free to choose which essay question we like. If we get a 6, the professor chooses the essay question. By the way, all questions are hard. Q1 asks us that we should have watched a rap battle before hand and then to make an analysis out of it. Q2 asks us to watch a movie and then write insightful conclusions. Q3 asks us to listen to a song and relate it to real world scenarios (I can’t remember the song but it definitely has a lot of double meanings, vulgar, etc.), Q4 asks us to write on something else which I cannot remember. So here’s the deal, if we intend to write the essay in-class, then we have to be prepared and remember all these things as the test is closed book. And we have limited pressure time as well. On the flipside, if we choose to do the essay before hand, that’s good because it is “open-book” and we have lots more time to work on it. The only catch is, we have no clue what the essay question will be since the die rolling would only happen during the beginning of the class of test day. Clearly, the only solution is to do all four essay questions, because it is bound that one of the questions will be the essay question for the test. All topics are hard and I was coming from an illness. It was hard to do all four of the essay questions. But I did them anyway so I could get it over with and I don’t need to stress about memorizing them for the test and for writing in class. So I finished them all in one night (yes, all-nighter). And then on the day of the test, the die rolled a 3, which means all of us will do Q3 of the essay questions for the exam. It was about writing real world on the vulgarious song and that was a struggle I had. It was hard to express myself while still maintaing to be “clean”. Anyways, I handed my paper in to the professor and left. The week after, I received my marked test from the prof and I got an F. I looked at the comments and feedback written on the last page of my essay and it was all a blur as I couldn’t remember until now what he wrote. But I did not complaint, because I remembered telling myself that all his comments were correct and they were meaningful and insightful. And rather than objectifying, I accepted it wholly and took it upon myself to use it as a motivation to improve and be better. Later in the course, he gave us a bonus requirement, where he asked us to read a short novel and write some insightful analysis on it. I was happy that I was able to redeem myself and I never knew what my grade was on that since it was submitted on the day of the final exam (which professors don’t usually reveal). I ended up with a C+ for the course and I was happy and I’ll take it, as I am not strong in literature. This I think is good enough for me. The takeway is not to pull-off an all nighter, coming from sickness is not an excuse to pull off an all-nighter. It would have been better to ask the professor for an extension or something, as I was not feeling well and I came from being sick and never considered that it will be hard to write a test while on that condition. <br><br>
