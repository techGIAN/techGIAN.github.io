			This story was when I was in still in the Philippines, in university precisely in Manila. It was my first year of uni and I was living in a dorm. But this story of how I came to be known as the “Boy Shindig” happened to be around close to the end of my first year. I told myself that before the end of my study at university, I have to attend at least one college party. Or basically I thought why not do it now, even as early as my first year? And so I decided to go to this org’s year-end shindig when I saw the poster ad in one of the hallways of the building after my class ended. I wasn’t from this org as it was a business org, but everyone is invited to come anyways. It is open to anybody, even college students outside our school. There was a fee to get in because we can get unlimited drinks and we can party to our hearts content. My friend from another org told me that she’s interested in going when she found out that I was planning to go, and so we bought our tickets (have to be bought in advance because buying there is more expensive), which is a few days before the college party. By the way, the business org who hosts this year-end shindig, has a name for the theme yearly. On that year, I recall it was called “Illuso” or something like that. It had a flashy name, which was cool. My friend who bought the ticket with me, let’s just call her Vanica (of course, not the real name, just a pseudonym and I can’t think of a better name lol), told me how her other friend wanted to come to the party as well. So she said that the three of us can go together to the party. By the way, the name of her friend is Daniella. I haven’t met her before but I will on the day of the event.<br><br>

			So the day of the shindig came. I had some programming contest that I joined in the morning, where I had some of my CompSci friends also join and so we all decided to go to KFC right after (just across the street of our school of where the contest was held) for lunch. We got there at around 3 pm because it was a late lunch. I was eating quickly just so I could go and dress up real nicely for the shindig, which should be around 7 pm. But even if the doors open at 7, the real thing actually happens at around 10 or 10:30 pm. So anyway, I told my CompSci friends that I have to go because of things I gotta do. By the way, I didn’t tell them about the Shindig that I plan on going to, just because there’s this stigma in our CompSci program (or basically some program with the sciences), that partying out isn’t really your thing and that only the business people are the only ones fit for partying. And if they catch you partying or something like that, they just call you names or whatever. And so I left at around 4, just so I could go home (my dorm is nearby) and showered and dressed up nicely for the party. Vanica and I decided to meet up at around 5 pm and that’s where Daniella will be as well. Crazy thing is, they thought of meeting me at the same KFC where me and my CompSci friends ate for lunch. And those CompSci people are probably still there cause they just want to hangout even if they already finished eating. And so I was like fuck it, I went anyway at 5 pm to KFC to meet Vanica - and I also got to meet Daniella for the first time too. She was pretty when I met her for the first time, but not the type that I would hit on. I shook hands and i just thought of her as an acquaintance. The three of us went inside and decided to grab a bite to eat for dinner before going to the shindig. And guess what? The CompSci fam are still there and smirks can be seen on their faces. I was like facepalming and holy shit. That’s where the whole “Boy Shindig” thing came to be. In our CompSci block, it would seem like I was the first one to actually attend a college shindig. And so that’s how it is I guess. Anyways, I still am looking forward to this party and just ignored those guys when I saw them.<br><br>

			Fast forward to the shindig, we came there and got there early, around 6:30 pm. We thought there will be traffic and so thought to go there early. Seems like we wrong and had to wait outside. Doors began to open at 7, showed our tickets and went inside. I even saw my high school classmates from there (by the way, I hated those guys but we still greeted each other as if we don’t hate each other, they’re probably one of the reasons why I hated high school, which is for another story). Ok, going back, so we went inside and the girls first went to the washroom before we went into the main stadium where the party will actually be held. I went to the guys room too just so to save time. Things were already set up and there were already some people inside the staidium already partying and getting drinks. Vanica invited me that the three of us should get have our photos taken at the photobooth before coming inside. We don’t want look drunk and wasted when we have our photos taken. And so we went to the photobooth and once we had our photos about to be taken, I put my hands around them - waist (they didn’t really ask me to backoff) and just went with it. The photo does make me look like an actual stud. It’s really embarrassing on my end because that’s not my personality and that I didn’t really want that photo to reflect who I am. And so I just hope the CompSci fam doesn’t see this humiliating photo.<br><br>

			Ok, so Vanica, Daniella and I went inside and started partying and getting free unlimited drinks from the bar (not free but you get the idea). I kept of drinking because I have high tolerance, although I didn’t really know what was in those drinks and what are they. But I just drank up as if it was my night of my life. Ok fast-forward to Monday (by the way, the event happened on a Saturday night). And guess what happened? Of course I still was being teased “Boy Shindig” or “stud”, but literally I think it was being teased in playful manner. Like they still like me and didn’t hate me, which is a good thing, right? And they’d show me a picture - apparently it was from the shindig photobooth with me, Daniella and Vanica. Palmface, I forgot that the shinidig photobooth’s photos always get uploaded to their Facebook site within 24 hours.<br><br>

			And so that’s where I got the nickname boy shindig. But I think of it as compliment too, that I was first among our block to be able to go to a college shindig. And that attending one has already been crossed off my bucketlist early on. There was another party that I attended, also hosted by the same business org but that’s a story for another time by the Boy Shindig. Happy New Year everyone!<br><br>
