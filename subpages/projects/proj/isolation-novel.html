			Quick intro. So basically, when I was around ten (or twelve maybe; all I remember is that these are really old and obsolete maybe 10-12 years ago?), the quick summary of this was that I was staying at my cousin's for the summer. Until one day, my cousin got a contagious disease wherein he had to quarantine himself in his room and that I had to be locked up (well I isolated myself in another room). I didn't go out for most of the time. This was composition many many years ago, so it wouldn't be as good as what I'm writing now (so proud and happy of how much I have improved since then but still has so much room for improvement). And as I was saying, I am not too sure as to whether I would like to continue pursuing the novel. (And by the way, ignore the typos and spelling and grammatical errors. It can get annoying). *Disclaimer: The cringe is real.* And so, without further ado, here are first 10 chapters of the Isolation Novel: <br><br>

			<div id="ch1" style="display:none; padding-left: 20px">
				<p>
				It was a beautiful Saturday morning, the fourth of June. Though, it was a fine
				day, everything in that day turned out gloomy. You want to know why? Well, as
				for myself, I let my readers decipher what was going on. I don’t just narrate
				right away. Sometimes, the best way to narrate a story is by implying the main
				idea. This way, readers would become eager of what they’re reading.
				</p>
				<p>
				If you were not able to decipher these events after reading the story, then it
				proves that you did not understand a single word you have read. Though the real
				meaning of the statements are hidden, but through context clues, it would be
				easy to derive the events!
				</p>
				<p>
				Now, are you ready? Sit back, grab a cup of some hot beverage, and get ready for
				action!
				</p>
				<p>
				As I was saying, the fourth day of the sixth month of the year was a beautiful,
				but gloomy Saturday morning. I came to wake up on a not-so much important day in
				my cousin’s house. I had to wake up early on that day. I have a dentist
				appointment at 10 AM. It was already quarter to 9, and yet, I haven’t prepared
				my most important meal of the day, breakfast.
				</p>
				<p>
				Quickly, I rushed downstairs, then off to the kitchen, but to my surprise,
				sausages and scrambled eggs are prepared on the dining table. I had the thought
				of someone nice would already have prepared our morning meal. I was glad. I
				checked the kitchen, there goes my aunt, cooking more sausages.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Let me help you cook sausages, aunt!” I exclaimed to her.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Now, dear. I’ll do it myself,” a kind voice came out of her lips. “In the
				meantime, kindly toast some bread. It’s on the dining table,” she added.
				</p>
				<p>
				I couldn’t say no, since I’m staying in their house at the meantime. I wanted to
				help them, since their household helper went on a 3-month vacation (woah, that’s
				too long!).
				</p>
				<p>
				But before I reached for the bread, I checked the Grandfather clock, just
				situated beside the dining table. It was already 9. I had to prepare the toast
				quickly. I placed the bread inside the toaster immediately.
				</p>
				<p>
				While the bread is being toasted, I ran to my cousin’s room. I woke her up. She
				was going to the dentist too. So I had to wake her up and she sat down by the
				dining table at once.
				</p>
				<p>
				Aunt laid the sausages in front of her, while I got the toasts. I spread butter
				on the toasts and laid them on the table. The three of us ate immediately.
				</p>
				<p>
				After eating, I took my regular bath and brushed my teeth. I was ready to go. My
				cousin didn’t, ‘cause we were going to be late. My aunt already had her shower
				before running to the kitchen. All, but one was complete in the recipe. Someone,
				who could, or maybe, who will, become the star of the show with what you’re
				going to read. This, is the beginning, the beginning of the root.
				</p>
				<p>
				You will soon find out who this guy is. You will meet him, which actually marks
				the root of the true isolation. Don’t believe me? Well, I rather will.
				</p>
				<p>
				Don’t know how he becomes the star and not me? Don’t know how he enters the
				picture?
				</p>
				<p>
				Like I said, there are no revelations. All these are implied. Just reading one
				statement (or maybe just the title itself) may already tell you what was going
				on.
				</p>
				<p>
				You have questions? Save it for later. It’s best if you keep them first. It
				would be logical to do, since your questions will be answered later.
				</p>
				<p>
				How about my aunt and my cousin? How come I don’t reveal their names? I’ll
				reveal them soon, don’t worry.
				</p>
				<p>
				To tell the truth, I didn’t use the words of the last sentences of the
				11<sup>th</sup> paragraph up to the 16<sup>th</sup> (or maybe 17<sup>th</sup>
				paragraph). Writing this story made me do it.
				</p>
				<p>
				Fiction? Some parts are fictional, and never really happened. Using hyperbolic
				and ironic figures of speech help me make a good story up.
				</p>
				<p>
				Figured it out yet? Don’t worry, you’ll figure it out soon.
				</p>
				<p>
				Well, hey… Do you want to know what happened next? Okay, then we shall. Now,
				turn to the next page, and watch how the events turn around. For the root of the
				isolation, we’ll know if he turns out to be the protagonist, or the antagonist.

			<p><span id="chapter2" class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-right" onclick="show('chapter2', 'ch2');"></span> <span class="emph" style="color:#194a89; font-size:75%; vertical-align: text-top;"> CHAPTER 02: The Revelation </span></p>
			<div id="ch2" style="display:none; padding-left: 20px">
				<p>
				Woah! The chapter name! If on the previous chapter, I keep saying, “Events are
				implied,” here I shall reveal some of the most vital parts of the story which
				will then be used towards the story ending.
				</p>
				<p>
				Take note that in revealing some names, I used code names, which may help in
				hiding the person’s identities.
				</p>
				<p>
				To start off, my cousin. Her name, Annie, my Cousin Annie. She’s a good artist,
				who loves to draw, and read books. She also likes anime and likes to be with
				friends.
				</p>
				<p>
				I have been really close with Annie, since when we were kids. I often tease her
				about in some things, but in the same way, we still treated each other like good
				friends, like good cousins, and even siblings!
				</p>
				<p>
				Next, is my Aunt, Aunt Diet. Aunt Diet is the mother of Annie. my dad and she
				are siblings, which also makes Annie and I cousins.
				</p>
				<p>
				Aunt Diet has been so nice to me and to my dad. She considers us as part of the
				family, and same goes to them. She is a hard worker, and also the reason why I
				liked being at their home.
				</p>
				<p>
				We often help Aunt Diet and Annie with chores like washing the dishes, preparing
				meals, doing the laundry, cleaning the house, and so much more. Working with
				them is such a pleasure. And we thought of helping them in return of them
				accepting us into their home.
				</p>
				<p>
				You might also ask about my dad? Hmmm… Let me think… Nope! Not yet! It would be
				too early for you to know. But I’ll describe him a little bit.
				</p>
				<p>
				He’s a hard worker. He helps me in my studies when I was young, and so much
				more! He’s a master chef and oh man, he makes delicious dishes like banana
				cakes, pizzas, and more! Not too much detail about him, though. He’s not the
				object here. But he may become the new object later. We’ll see.
				</p>
				<p>
				Now, let me describe the root! The root is actually one of my other cousin. He’s
				Annie’s big brother, and BIG BOTHER.
				</p>
				<p>
				From the sounds of it, I may have described the root to be a BIG BOTHER, since
				he is the one to bother me, which leads to the isolation.
				</p>
				<p>
				He’s name is Sammy. Sammy would be the root of all this, the root of which
				problems like these, arose.
				</p>
				<p>
				Sammy has been a naughty guy. But sometimes, he could be a big help around the
				house. His mischief could give some smiles to the members of the house. But
				sometimes, this mischief can give frowns and angers. Too much of this mischief
				is not good as well. Remember, too much of anything is not good!
				</p>
				<p>
				Sammy is also taking a culinary subject. He wanted to be a master chef, just
				like my dad!
				</p>
				<p>
				Well, I guess I already have answered why Sammy is a big bother on a very
				beautiful, but gloomy June 4.
				</p>
				<p>
				How about the root? How could Sammy be a cause? How could he be a root of
				isolation?
				</p>
				<p>
				It’s too soon to speak of it. I guess, that it would be alright to reveal each
				one’s personalities. But what are other things you must know to complete the
				first phase of the story? These things are the keys to solving the mystery.
				</p>
				<p>
				Though I may not be preceeding to our main story, it would be good to know if I
				give you some details, on some essential elements you need to know.
				</p>
				<p>
				First, where is my dad? He has not been introduced in Chapter 1, right? He was
				only first heard of in this chapter, when I was talking about Aunt Diet. Where
				is he?
				</p>
				<p>
				Second, are we even ready to go to the dentist? And who’s coming with us? My dad
				was supposed to be cooking, since he’s a master chef! How about Sammy? Is he
				going with us to the dentist? Does he have an appointment with the dentist too?
				</p>
				<p>
				Third, how about the real story? Did you just think I wasted 3 pages for this
				chapter, without any real life story? And hell, ya! This is a narrator’s job.
				</p>
				<p>
				And fourth, how come the author forgot to describe himself? Forgot to reveal
				himself? He’s one of the characters too, right? Is he an antagonist, or the
				hero?
				</p>
				<p>
				Well, the fourth revelation got a little bit off guard. Well, yeah, he’s one of
				the characters. The author is not the protagonist nor the antagonist. But, he
				will be revealing himself soon.
				</p>
				<p>
				Breathe in slowly, then breathe it out again slowly. Easy and come down. These
				questions are quite intriguing, which is actually the key to understanding the
				beginnings of the story.
				</p>
				<p>
				Get ready now. Though, the third chapter is not a the main story again, at least
				it will now serve as the KEY in solving such an ambiguous beginning.
				</p>

			<div id="ch3" style="display:none; padding-left: 20px">
				<p>
				The Key. What key? What am I talking about? This I actually the key for you to
				understand how everything began.
				</p>
				<p>
				If you are asking where my dad is, simple and yet a long story. I shall begin
				with this very long story.
				</p>
				<p>
				I had a summer Math training last April, which lasted for 1 month until May. I
				stayed in Annie’s house for that 1 month duration, since the training venue is
				near Annie’s house, and very far from where I lived (yet to be revealed later
				on). After training, my dad and I decided to stay after my training to help them
				with chores and other stuff, since their household helper went on the vacation I
				was telling you about last Chapter 1. It all boiled out to a life-making
				decision last May 30, which is actually this week, a Monday. I asked him if we
				could already go home by Friday, June 3. His refused, since I still have to go
				with Annie’s family to the Baptism of our youngest family member. I had to tell
				this to mom (which is not with me at the moment). I asked her if she could plead
				my dad to go home by that Friday. When my dad found this out, he got mad at me.
				But since, I had no more choice, I had to stay until Sunday, which is the actual
				Baptismal date. And also, he had to go back home on a Friday, to take care of
				some important things. I had nothing to do to stop him.
				</p>
				<p>
				You might wonder why I needed to go home? I have classes by next week, June 13,
				and I really needed to go home and prepare for my upcoming classes.
				</p>
				<p>
				Monday’s decision was life-making. It was crucial. It determines the events on
				June 4, which you will later know.
				</p>
				<p>
				Going back, I didn’t know why he wanted me to stay. Ii didn’t even want to go to
				this Baptismal date. My classes are more important. That’s my numero uno
				priority, but looks like I had no choice but to abide by him.
				</p>
				<p>
				That Friday, I felt like I needed to take a nap. On this nap of mine, I dreamt
				that there is something bad that could happen, some bad effect within this 3-day
				weekend, something bad in Annie’s house.
				</p>
				<p>
				But since I could not recall after I woke up (5 minutes after waking up 50% of
				your dream will be forgotten, and 10 minutes after waking up, 90% of your dream
				will be forgotten), I had no reason to show my dad, and too bad, I have recalled
				nothing. I’m sunk!
				</p>
				<p>
				Then he left. I slept in with Sammy on the night of June 3. Annie slept in her
				room that night.
				</p>
				<p>
				And the next morning, which was June 4, were actually the events from Chapter 1.
				</p>
				<p>
				Second answer to the question back in Chapter 2, Aunt Diet and Sammy joined
				Annie and I to the dentist. They dropped us in front of the clinic and the two
				went to the hospital. There were  2 missions we had to undergo. The first
				mission was to visit the dentist and the second was for the reader to figure
				out. (I told you that there’s just no revelation, but also analysis!)
				</p>
				<p>
				There’s actually no waste in 3 pages there. Those pages are actually keys and
				revelations, which help both the author and the reader.
				</p>
				<p>
				These pages help the author because he needed to give the readers clues to the
				main events, and not just giving away.
				</p>
				<p>
				And at the same time, these keys and revelations actually function as clues for
				the readers to analyze.
				</p>
				<p>
				Combining these keys and revelations together with the first events from the
				first chapter can cook us up conspicuous ideas. That would be the perfect recipe
				to create such an unvague flavor.
				</p>
				<p>
				As for the fourth answer, nah… You do not need to know about that.
				</p>
				<p>
				Now, I believe that the story must continue. This way, we would gain more
				information for the isolation – how, when, who, where?
				</p>
				<p>
				Are you ready? I’m sure you are. Sit back, relax, grab your ipods, or prepare
				some hot toast, ‘cause the story is about to continue.
				</p>
				<p>
				Prepare now and turn to the next page, where you will know the next events, to
				the ever-so dreaded ISOLATION.
				</p>
			</div>

			<p><span id="chapter4" class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-right" onclick="show('chapter4', 'ch4');"></span> <span class="emph" style="color:#194a89; font-size:75%; vertical-align: text-top;"> CHAPTER 04: The Results </span></p>
			<div id="ch4" style="display:none; padding-left: 20px">
				<p>As I was saying from Chapter 1, after Aunt Diet, Annie, and I ate, I took a
				shower and was ready to go. My cousin did not bother to take a shower. Aunt
				already had hers. Sammy ate breakfast while I was taking my shower. He did not
				bother to take a bath either.
				</p>
				<p>
				We all head out to their van, to take care of our 2 missions, which were to go
				to the dentist and to undergo a special mission.
				</p>
				<p>
				Aunt Diet drove the van, while Annie and I sat together at the front row, with
				Aunt Diet. Sammy lied down at the 3<sup>rd</sup> row of the van.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Remember, we must never close the windows of the vehicle,” Aunt Diet exclaimed.
				“I know it’s hot, but it’s for the sake of Sammy, and for the three of us,” she
				added.
				</p>
				<p>
				I heard Sammy’s mutterings from the back of the vehicle, hoping he would stop
				all his complaints. But he would not. I had nothing to do. I can’t stop him. I’m
				riding inside their van. I must show them respect.
				</p>
				<p>
				On our drive, I became worried of Sammy, though he shut his mouth up. Aunt felt
				the same way as well, even before we rode the van. Annie did not feel anxious.
				You don’t know how the two siblings fight with each other. It was such a sibling
				rivalry between the two. This rivalry also provided a very good relationship
				between them, which made the two strong.
				</p>
				<p>
				Sammy is not in a very good shape right now; that is why I became worried. But,
				he’s also a member of my Revenge List, if you know what I mean. But in his case
				right now, I cannot formulate a plan to seek vengeance. I did not even want to
				lay a finger on him in this instance.
				</p>
				<p>
				We had to hurry. It’s almost quarter to 10, and the dentist appointment is at 10
				in the morning. And the van’s gas tank is almost hitting empty. Aunt Diet and I
				were filled with pity when we saw Sammy’s conditions.
				</p>
				<p>
				She sped the van up. We hit the gasoline station at once. We asked for a quick
				service, to fill the tank up and have paid using her credit card. The service
				was quick. It was less than 5 minutes. It was the quickest service in the gas
				station I had had.
				</p>
				<p>
				But now is not the time to be impressed. The gas station was not our goal. It
				was the 2 missions. We geared up our engine and began our drive towards the
				quests. The engine of the van sounded as if it was a race car. “Zoom!” it went
				off!
				</p>
				<p>
				We immediately went to our first mission – the dentist. Aunt Diet dropped Annie
				and I off in front of the clinic. She gave Annie twelve dollars and told us to
				give her a call once both of us were done. Then Aunt Diet drove off to prepare
				for the 2<sup>nd</sup> mission.
				</p>
				<p>
				I wanted to help her for the second quest, but she said it was too dangerous. So
				I let her fulfill the second mission.
				</p>
				<p>
				Annie and I walked towards the clinic. I knocked on the door, but no one
				answered.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Why not try ringing the doorbell?” Annie suggested.
				</p>
				<p>
				I gave the doorbell a loud buzz. The loud sound pierced my ears. It was really
				loud! But still, no one answered the door.
				</p>
				<p>
				I checked the door. It had a little note in it, which said:
				</p>
				<p>
				    “The dentist is out. I just had a little snack. I’ll be back at exactly
				10:00 AM.”
				</p>
				<p>
				Looks like Annie and I had nothing to do but wait. Annie got her phone from her
				bag to check if there was anyone who sent her a message. There was none. She
				kept her phone, and then brought out her iPod and her earphones. Plugged one in
				her left ear, and the other in her right ear, and then she inserted the end to
				her iPod. She selected a very soft and slow song and listened to it while
				waiting for the dentist.
				</p>
				<p>
				I also got my iPod, and instead of listening to music, I played some games, to
				entertain me. I was just too tired to listen to my music that I tried to play
				some fine games.
				</p>
				<p>
				It was already 5 to 9, and yet the dentist hasn’t come by. We were both getting
				bored.
				</p>
				<p>
				“How long will we wait around here?” Annie complained.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Don’t you worry, Annie. He said he will be back at exactly 10,” I exclaimed.
				</p>
				<p>
				My iPod is already low in battery. I have to charge it at once. But, instead, I
				just turned it off.
				</p>
				<p>
				Annie also got tired listening to her music. She stowed her iPod away and just
				waited for the dentist to come along.
				</p>
				<p>
				Suddenly, I saw a shadow of a man pass by. It was Dr. Clay, the dentist. Both of
				us said hello as he removed the note on his door. He got the key to his clinic
				and opened the door. We sat by the couch and waited who will be first in line in
				his chair. It was me.
				</p>
				<p>
				I did not fear the dentist a single bit. I liked getting my teeth clean, and of
				course to have my retainers checked.
				</p>
				<p>
				Annie also went to see Dr. Clay to have her retainers checked but she once
				feared him when he attaches her braces. It was hysterical moment where I laughed
				at her back then.
				</p>
				<p>
				I sat down by his dental chair and I opened my teeth widely. He said that I have
				to keep my retainers on 24-7, since my teeth are not yet as strong as it should
				be.
				</p>
				<p>
				There was really nothing to do but check. The check-up was A-OK and I rose up
				from his chair and sat beside Annie as Dr. Clay asked her to sit down by the
				dental chair.
				</p>
				<p>
				Same thing happened with Annie, nothing really happened. We were advised to keep
				our retainers on.
				</p>
				<p>
				We were ready to go, but Annie had a question to raise from Dr. Clay.
				</p>
				<p>
				“How much is your Cleaning Services?” Annie asked, but was not that curious.
				</p>
				<p>
				“I’ll charge you for somewhere between 5 to 6 dollars, depending on your teeth,”
				Dr. Clay told her.
				</p>
				<p>
				Not as much eager, she said, “Thanks, I’ll think about it. We have to go.”
				</p>
				<p>
				Both of us bid him goodbye as we exited the door.
				</p>
				<p>
				I called up Aunt Diet to tell her that the examination has been complete. But no
				one is picking up the phone. I tried for 5 missed calls, and yet, no one is
				picking it up.
				</p>
				<p>
				“I hope Aunt Diet and Sammy is alright with their missions. I’m becoming
				anxious,” Annie confesses her feelings.
				</p>
				<p>
				I tried to comfort her. I had to know what was going on. I had to know if the
				second mission was a success. I had to know what’s our next move. I had to know
				the complete details as soon as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
				I bet you also want to know what happened next and for the other details. Turn
				to the next page and I’ll let you know what happened next!

				We, Annie and I, still continue to worry about Aunt Diet. No text-back. No
				answer from the phone either. There was no hesitation. We felt anxious, grieved.
				Many things entered my mind on what was really going on. I also felt many mixed
				emotions. Nothing made our feelings changed. We were unhesitant. We still
				continued to feel the same way. It was either Aunt Diet’s voice or her text
				messages which will make us feel better.
				</p>
				<p>
				Where were we anyway? After we exited the dentist’s clinic, where did we go?
				</p>
				<p>
				Well, actually, we only stayed in front of the clinic. Dr. Clay was preparing
				for his next patient. We did not want to disturb him in his work. Our
				appointment is over and it is only polite to leave him alone in his work. But
				Annie and I had nowhere to go. We had to stay there.
				</p>
				<p>
				It was ten minutes past the time when we were dismissed and still no response
				from Aunt Diet. We already made a total of seven missed calls and sent her four
				text messages. Aunt Diet did not respond to any of form of these communications.
				</p>
				<p>
				Annie sat down by the door hedges while I continue to stand by her.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Look at the weather, Annie. It’s about to drizzle,” I told Annie.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Yes, I know that Carlo,” Annie grieved. “The weather is gloomy as well,” she
				added.
				</p>
				<p>
				Well, yeah, my name is Carlo. Sorry, I didn’t want to know my name, but yes, she
				spoiled it up.
				</p>
				<p>
				Both of us also felt the feeling of being bored. So, Annie got her iPod and
				listened to her favourite tunes, while I kept my eyes on my phone, if in case
				Aunt Diet responds.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Oh by the way, what was the twelve dollars Aunt Diet gave to you before for?” I
				asked her curiously.
				</p>
				<p>
				“You know what, I forgot to ask her. Maybe lunch money?” Annie said unsure with
				her answer as she shrugged her shoulders.
				</p>
				<p>
				Fifteen minutes pasted away. We were both getting more bored and more worried.
				Suddenly, we heard the sound of a soft bell. Both of us were alerted. The sound
				came from the other side of the street. There, we saw a cat with a bell tied
				around its neck.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Oh, so that’s where the sound of the bell came from,” I concluded.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Looks like it has an owner,” Annie added.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Huh?!” I showed her a grinned face.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Well, you know. The cat has a bell tied around its neck. Who could have placed
				it there? It must have an owner,” Annie explained. “It also works like a dog
				tag,” she added.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Oh, alright. If you say so…” I agreed but did not listened to a single word she
				said.
				</p>
				<p>
				The cat ran away. It must have seen us and have been startled. Too much to the
				excitement, Aunt Diet responded to my text message saying:
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Why have you not answered my calls? I sent 3 calls to Annie but she was not
				picking it up. And please don’t send me up to 7 missed calls again. My phone’s
				battery reduces when you do this. Thanks!”
				</p>
				<p>
				Looks like too much of our cat excitement, we forgot to keep an eye on our
				phones. But we did not regret it. Our phones were set on a silent mode. But we
				did not anymore care. Annie checked her phone at once and found 3 missed calls
				from Aunt Diet. Immediately, she called her. The phone was ringing.
				</p>
				<p>
				Aunt Diet picked it up at once and said:
				</p>
				<p>
				    “Annie, I have no more time to have a greet of ‘Hi’ and ‘Hello’ anymore. My
				next instruction to you is to go with Carlo and walk to the nearest restaurant,
				which is just in front of a hospital. Use the money I gave you to eat your lunch
				there. Sorry about it being an early lunch. I’ll call back later for further
				instructions. Bye!”
				</p>
				<p>
				Before Annie could even speak, Aunt Diet already hanged the phone up. I asked
				Annie what Aunt Diet said.
				</p>
				<p>
				“What? What did Aunt Diet said?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“We were told to walk to the nearest restaurant from here, which is just in
				front of a hospital.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“That’s it?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“And eat an early lunch as we wait for her next instructions.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“You forgot to say ‘Hi’.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“She said she had no more time to say these jibberish.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“And Aunt Diet? How was she?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“She did not have any more time to explain either.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Oh, okay. Well, we better make a move-on.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“I agree.”
				</p>
				<p>
				Annie and I walked slowly towards the restaurant. It was such a gloomy day and
				we wanted to enjoy it.
				</p>
				<p>
				Along the way, many curious questions still aroused my mind of what things are
				happening. My mind is also thinking of such a logical explanation which may give
				answers to these questions.
				</p>
				<p>
				Though we heard Aunt Diet’s responses, we still do not know what was happening
				to Aunt Diet.
				</p>
				<p>
				And how about Sammy? Where is he? Is he with Aunt Diet? And what about his
				not-so good conditions? What was his conditions right now?
				</p>
				<p>
				Are these events even related to the Isolation Event in the upcoming events? And
				what was the Isolation really about?
				</p>
				<p>
				If you would turn the page over to the next, you might obtain some answers to
				these questions.

			<div id="ch6" style="display:none; padding-left: 20px">
				<p>
				Annie and I began our walk towards the restaurant. I asked Annie what the name
				of the restaurant was.
				</p>
				<p>
				“What was the name of the restaurant?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Burgies and Burgees.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“So it’s a hamburger restaurant.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Well, sort of. That restaurant is actually just a fast-food chain. But many
				prefer to call it a restaurant.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“The place is huge?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Not that huge. Just a small piece of lot was rented to their place. But now, I
				think they own the lot.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Great food?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Never tasted it. But many say they have some delicious dishes.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“And we are going to eat there?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Yes, Aunt Diet said we will. We’ll use the money she gave us.”
				</p>
				<p>
				We made it one-fourth of the way. It was a long walk, maybe fifteen to twenty
				minutes of walking. As we were walking along, we passed by an old school. It was
				already torn down and we hoped to walk faster so that we would not get caught up
				by this school. Rumors has it that the old school was torn down because of the
				many students who saw many ghosts. The school was considered haunted. Suddenly,
				Annie muttered.
				</p>
				<p>
				“That school… I remember that school!”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Yeah? What about the school? It’s haunted, right?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“You’re right about that. But, there’s something else.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Sure, go on. Continue on with your story.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“I once taught Art classes there.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Really?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Yes. We were having an Outreach Activity.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“What about this Outreach Activity?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Our school has chosen us to have an Outreach Activity and they chose this
				school where our Outreach Activity will be held.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Go on…”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Our class chose to teach those little kids. I personally chose to teach an Art
				Class.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“When was this?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“I think I was a Sophomore back then. But it was a worthy experience I will
				never forget.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Was the school really haunted? Have you seen a ghost?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Beats me if it was haunted or not. I don’t even believe in ghosts and have
				never seen one. So I think that’s pretty much easy to assume that the school
				never deserved to be torn down.”
				</p>
				<p>
				I smiled at her and giggled. I also shared one of my Outreach Activities in
				school as well.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Back when I was a Sophomore too, my classmates and I selected a very poor
				school where we taught some subjects as well. I taught them a Math subject. The
				others chose Reading anyway.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“So, we both have the same experiences then.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Well, yeah. Sort of. My experience did not involve any ghosts in it.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Well, you could be right.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“And back when I was in Freshmen life, our class cleaned up the whole school
				campus! It was a tiresome experience but it was worth it!”
				</p>
				<p>
				“What form of cleaning did you do?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“We picked up falling leaves from the trees. It was not that difficult, but it
				was not easy either.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“I always wanted to clean… if I’m not that lazy.”
				</p>
				<p>
				Both of us giggled. And I also shared my Junior life Outreach Activity.
				</p>
				<p>
				“I also experienced talking to prisoners back when I was a Junior.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“So, how’d it go?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“I was kind of nervous at first but I came through like a boss!”
				</p>
				<p>
				Both of us giggled and laughed. Those were really worthy experiences.
				</p>
				<p>
				I really enjoyed going to Outreach Activities, and same goes with Annie as well.
				I also reminded Annie of donating relief goods to the typhoon victims somewhat 3
				or 4 years ago. It was not part of our school activities but it was well worth
				it. We enjoyed that experience as well.
				</p>
				<p>
				During that typhoon, I also went to school to donate some relief goods as well.
				Also a worthy experience.
				</p>
				<p>
				Annie and I were halfway through. We almost forgot about the incidents that
				happened this morning. We were so happy and enjoying with our sharing. These
				incidents also pierced my mind to remind me, but I did not want to remind Annie
				about it. I’ll just let her remember it herself. I didn’t want to make her worry
				again.
				</p>
				<p>
				After those conversations, we became quiet. Annie wanted some silence as well. I
				wanted to rest my mind of any other emotions or any other things.
				</p>
				<p>
				After 5 minutes, we were almost near the restaurant. We already caught a glimpse
				of the logo of “Burgies and Burgees”. Both of us were excited. We wanted to dine
				in immediately. The long walk made our feet tired and made our stomachs hungry.
				I invited Annie to race with me going there but she refused. The restaurant was
				across the street and did not want me to just go running off there.
				</p>
				<p>
				We looked at both directions, left and right as we crossed the street. And alas!
				We have reach the fast-food chain, or the restaurant as what everyone preferred
				it to call. “Burgies and Burgees” is not a bad place from my first look.
				Quickly, we went inside the restaurant.
				</p>
				<p>
				What could be the next instructions given to us by Aunt Diet after we eat our
				meal?
				</p>
				<p>
				Will we get disappointed or overjoyed after our tongue tips touched the food
				from the fast-food chain, or the ever-so popular “restaurant” as they call it?
				</p>
				<p>
				Does the Activities in School have something to do with the Isolation Event?
				</p>
				<p>
				And how our Sammy’s conditions right now?
				</p>

			<div id="ch7" style="display:none; padding-left: 20px">
				<p>
				The outside of the restaurant is not that bad at all. I would not care about the
				atmosphere. I would rather enjoy the food. If I will talk about the atmosphere
				outside, many homeless children would hang around the mirrors of the place. I
				did not care about them when I entered the place. I just didn’t wish to be
				dirty, that’s all. In front of the place was a hospital. It had a modern
				architecture, just like the “Burgies and Burgees”. Many people enter and exit
				the hospital. I didn’t care about the name, though. I just wanted to eat. Beside
				the restaurant are small stalls were people usually pass by to obtain some
				information on where to go. They rarely buy there. The items in stock were a
				little less than limited. But the main entrance of the restaurant was absolutely
				fantastic! It caught our attention right away. From the looks of it, food will
				be good here as well.
				</p>
				<p>
				Annie and I entered at once and we asked the waiter to give us a table for two.
				We were sitted down on a small table just near the entrance of the restaurant.
				The waiter gave us the menu. We were astounded by the many selections of dishes
				we can choose from. But we were in a hurry as well. Our tummies are growling and
				we still need to make a call to Aunt Diet after we eat. I ordered the Double
				Cheeseburger and a Medium-sized fries. I also ordered a can of Dr. Pepper with
				it and a Small cup of Sundae. Annie ordered the Classic Cheeseburger and Small
				fries. She ordered a large bottle of soda pop and a hot fudge as well. Once the
				waiter got our orders, he ran to deliver the order immediately. We said that we
				were in a hurry.
				</p>
				<p>
				We waited for our meal to be served. For the meantime, Annie listened to her
				favourite beats on her iPod while I made a short phone call to my close
				childhood friend.
				</p>
				<p>
				I dialled the number and heard that the phone was ringing. Someone picked the
				phone up. It was my friend, Eric.
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Hello, Eric! Long time no see!”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Hello, Carlo! I know, it has been a while.”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “How are you?”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “I’m alright. I’m on a special project right now. I’ll call you back
				later, alright.”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Sure, whatever you say.”
				</p>
				<p>
				Those were my final words before I hung the phone up. I just didn’t want to
				disturb him right now. He might be on an important business. But what on the
				world is he doing right now? That was a question that echoed in my mind.
				</p>
				<p>
				The food was taking a while. But I’m sure that the chef wanted to make it
				special. I didn’t care how long it will take, as long as it will be served and
				it would taste well.
				</p>
				<p>
				Looks like Annie was enjoying her tunes right now. She used to be impatient,
				especially when she’s hungry and meals are taking long to serve. But in this
				instance, she did not even care.
				</p>
				<p>
				I was also checking my phone for updates and recent messages. Aunt Diet may also
				call as well. She may even send me a text message. I wanted to be notified on
				the recent news.
				</p>
				<p>
				On the restaurant was also a TV. But it was turned off. I asked the waiter if I
				could turn it on.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Excuse me, waiter!”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Yes, sir. May I help you?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“I was wondering if I could turn the TV on.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Of course, sir. No problem.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Hey, thanks!”
				</p>
				<p>
				I turned the TV on and the ever-so popular BCN (Broadcasting Center News) was
				on. I tried to watch some news on what’s going on with the Earth in which we
				live in. And I have heard some of the headlines:
				</p>
				<p>
				        “A Meteorite found on the center of the Rocky Desert”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Look at the Gloomy Weather, Cannot determine if it will be Raining or
				Shining”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Many Actresses will show off their beauty in front of the Plaza Stage
				tonight”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Technology continues to grow until today!”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Earthquake in Japan”
				</p>
				<p>
				I listened to each headline for today’s news. The first headline was that
				amazing. Scientists are studying this type of rare stone from outer space. They
				had had placed the stone in a museum near from where it was first found.
				</p>
				<p>
				The second headline features a weather forecast. Though, forecasters and
				meteorologists have the advanced equipment and modern technology to determine
				the upcoming weather forecast, it was still an odd day, since the weather keeps
				on changing back and forth, from sunny to cloudy and vice-versa. So, I guess I
				have to agree with them that there could be a possibility that it would be
				impossible to determine the next weather conditions.
				</p>
				<p>
				In the third headline for today’s news, it features some beautiful and pretty
				actresses who would do live concerts and tours in front of the many crowds,
				which will take place in the Plaza Stage. It would be nice if we could watch it
				but I just don’t have the budget right now and will be held from another
				country, which still takes many days away from here.
				</p>
				<p>
				Technology, as the fourth headline tells us, is growing, and until now- it keeps
				on growing. There are so many inventions today that will help make our lives
				easier. And until now, many of us are not yet still satisfied with our life, and
				still requires new technology to help get our lives more satisfied. This need
				that we desire is actually the mother of the modern new invention!
				</p>
				<p>
				And the final headline which features about the Earthquake in Japan, tells of
				the astonishing news about the Japan. I felt pitied and sympathized for them. My
				heart was moved with compassion. I would like to help, but as I said, I’m low on
				dough. I think it would be better if I could just pray for them, in hopes that
				their lives may still change.
				</p>
				<p>
				I turned the TV off. I guess that it would be time to have a little rest after
				seeing the news headlines for today.
				</p>
				<p>
				And right after that, our meals were served. I grabbed some French fries and
				placed them inside my mouth. It melted in my mouth. It was so delicious. I
				really liked the food and their service as well. Annie enjoyed her food too.
				Their burger was amazing too. They used 100% pure beef on the patty. Their
				sundae and their hot fudge was delicious too. I really enjoyed the dining
				experience.
				</p>
				<p>
				We ate fast. It’s not because we wanted to call up Aunt Diet at once. We were
				just so hungry and the food melted right away in our mouths. It was really good.
				I’d like to recommend the place. I would like to even share the dining
				experience. And that is why I shared this experience with you. Simply
				marvellous!
				</p>
				<p>
				We had to rest our tummies first. They was full. We could not eat another bite.
				What we need now is a stretcher (exaggerated!). Annie said she would breathe in
				some fresh air first. She gave me the money that Aunt Diet gave her. She gave me
				the responsibility to pay the bill. She exited through the door. I could still
				see her outside the window. I smiled.
				</p>
				<p>
				Then I asked the waited for our bill. I checked it out and found out that we
				have to pay $9 for the meal we ate. I placed a $10 bill on the table and wrote a
				piece of note on it saying:
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Your meal was absolutely fantastic. Please keep the change. You
				deserved it.”
				</p>
				<p>
				I think that could make them really happy. I’ll just tell Annie that our meal
				costs $10 so that she would not be curious of where the $1 would go.
				</p>
				<p>
				I rested for a while as well. I had to make an important phone call too. I had
				to call Aunt Diet at once.
				</p>
				<p>
				I went outside and told Annie that I have to visit the comfort room for a
				second. Then I went inside and asked the waiter where the comfort room was. He
				directed me through there and went inside. I did my business and made an
				important phone call to Aunt Diet. She picked the phone up and began our
				conversations immediately:
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Hello, Carlo! Is that you?”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Yes, Aunt.”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Are you done with your meal?”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Yes, Aunt.”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “I would like you to buy a chicken meal for Sammy. Have it to-go, then
				cross over the street.”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Crossing over the street would be--“
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Yes, it’s a hospital.”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Alright!”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Then, wait for me there. I’ll fetch you two there.”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “The good news is that he was discharged and the bad news is that he is
				positive on the disease.”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “What? That’s not good.”
				</p>
				<p>
				        “Yes, I know. We’ll talk about it later. I’ll see you in front of the
				hospital now. Bye!”
				</p>
				<p>
				She hung the phone right up. I knew it. It was not a good result. I had to alert
				Annie right away!
				</p>
				<p>
				Meanwhile, Annie still having her fresh air, saw the poor, homeless kids. Her
				heart was moved with pity and compassion. She felt the good to honest sympathy
				she never felt before. She thought of a very good idea.
				</p>
				<p>
				She went inside and ordered a small burger. She also told the waiter to give it
				to the children. That way, she would have helped them in a small way.
				</p>
				<p>
				On my side, I alerted Annie, who was shocked too when she heard the news from
				me. We ordered a chicken meal and have had it to-go. Then, we paid for the extra
				charges and exited the restaurant.
				</p>
				<p>
				We crossed over the street quickly, anxious to what happens next.
				</p>
				<p>
				Is Sammy okay? Will he be just alright? And Aunt Diet, is she okay? Will these
				events have something to do with the Isolation Event?
				</p>
				<p>
				Will Sammy be a real root to the Isolation Event, just as what I said from the
				first chapter?
				</p>
				<p>
				Will this chapter be any good reason be included in the Isolation Story?
				</p>
				<p>
				And how about my close friend, Eric? Does he have something to do with the
				Isolation Event?
				</p>
				<p>
				What will really happen next? If you feel that you’re adrenaline raising, I
				suggest to turn over to the next page and see!

			<div id="ch8" style="display:none; padding-left: 20px">
				<p>
				This is just a short chapter, a chapter which takes up to 3 short pages. I have
				included this chapter to talk about what I felt when we were crossing the
				street. This chapter is simply essential to help the reader know what other
				details he/she must know in order to fully understand what was going on.
				</p>
				<p>
				The plot was simple. We crossed over the street from the delicious hospital
				going to the hospital, which was just on the opposite side of the street. Though
				it was a simple plot, it occupied one chapter. This would eagerly help you
				understand fully what I was thinking about. I know that it may fit in just less
				than of a chapter, but I think it takes about 1 full, but short, chapter.
				</p>
				<p>
				As what this chapter implies, Chapter 8 (Questions, Questions, Questions) tells
				about the so many questions which echoed into my mind while crossing the street
				with Annie.
				</p>
				<p>
				Answers to such questions will be answered in the same chapter as well. Trust
				me, the answers were just so easy to answer, it just takes maybe one paragraph.
				</p>
				<p>
				But still out of these questions, some will not yet be answered. Some will be
				answered in some other chapters of the book. Some will be answered later on. And
				some will not be answered at all. You have to figure it out yourself. Some maybe
				a little difficult to answer but it proves to be a test if the reader fully
				understands what he/she is reading.
				</p>
				<p>
				This type of reading is a good test if you really understand what you are
				reading. If something is implied, that is good. It would be better that way
				rather than knowing what was really going on when the event was given away.
				</p>
				<p>
				But how on Earth would you determine what was happening through implied events?
				</p>
				<p>
				Simple, there are numerous ways. The first way is to read and read and read! If
				you do not understand something from the sentence you just read, read it again.
				If you still don’t understand, read it once more. Continue doing the process
				until you fully understood that sentence. Remember, don’t move on if you have
				not understood that part. It might be a crucial part, a climax, or the peak
				point of the story or novel you are reading. You might not understand the
				succeeding points of the selection if you have not understood that part.
				</p>
				<p>
				Second, consult your dictionary. If there is a word you do not understand in a
				sentence, do not hesitate in consulting a dictionary. This way, you could
				understand what the word meant, and hence, could result into better
				understanding of the sentence.
				</p>
				<p>
				When the sentence uses idioms and figures of speech, it means that the author
				would like to give colors to his work. Idioms are short phrases in which its
				true meaning is not literal while figures of speech works the same way. The
				third way of solving this problem is maybe consulting again the dictionary or
				you could surf it up in the internet, that’s what I do!
				</p>
				<p>
				The fourth way is to use context clues. Through the use of context clues, you
				could determine right away in such an easy matter the true meaning of the
				sentence which does not have a literal definition.
				</p>
				<p>
				Well, there you go, some ways which may help you understand fully sentences,
				paragraphs, or words which have implied meanings.
				</p>
				<p>
				Now, let’s go to the main point of the chapter. What are some questions that
				needs to be fully understood so you could understand the story fully?
				</p>
				<p>
				First question, could my dad be really become an object here, as what Chapter 2
				tries to tell us? Where is he anyway?
				</p>
				<p>
				Second question, how on Earth could Sammy be the root, as what Chapter 1 has
				been telling us?
				</p>
				<p>
				Third question, if Sammy would have been the root, and my dad could become the
				object later on, then would the two of them join forces in order for the
				Isolation to take place?
				</p>
				<p>
				Fourth question, I have been mentioning this “Isolation Event” since Chapter 1,
				who was isolated? Was I isolated? Who was really the one isolated? What events
				such took place that would lead to this event?
				</p>
				<p>
				Fifth question, do Annie and/or Aunt Diet have something to do with this
				Isolation Event?
				</p>
				<p>
				The answers to some of these questions will come to you a little later, and
				there I shall to reveal some answers to some questions.
				</p>
				<p>
				I believe that since you are eating out the excitement, I decided to give away
				some of these answers in the next chapter. I think that would be better, ey?
				</p>
				<p>
				I only promised 3 pages of Chapter 8. If I include the answers, it might take up
				to 5 pages already!
				</p>
				<p>
				Don’t worry, Chapter 9 would feature shorter pages this time, which reveals the
				answers.
				</p>
				<p>
				You might say that I wasted 1.5 pages trying to tell you how to read and
				understand the text. But it sure was a great help, ey?
				</p>
				<p>
				Now, if you are ready to rumble, check out the next page, which will help you
				answer the questions you have been reading in this chapter!
				</p>

			<p><span id="chapter9" class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-right" onclick="show('chapter9', 'ch9');"></span> <span class="emph" style="color:#194a89; font-size:75%; vertical-align: text-top;"> CHAPTER 09: The Answers </span></p>
			<div id="ch9" style="display:none; padding-left: 20px">
				<p>
				This chapter aims to provide definite answers to some of the questions you have
				just raised from the previous chapter. This is just a very short chapter which
				reaches up to two pages only. Though some questions which were raised were
				failed to answer, you may still figure them out throughout the end of the story.
				</p>
				<p>
				Ready? ‘Cause here we go!
				</p>
				<p>
				The first question which was raised was asking where my dad really is and how he
				will become the object in the story.
				</p>
				<p>
				The truth behind this is that my dad is not around at the moment but he promised
				to pick me up by tomorrow night, that is, June 5 on a Sunday.
				</p>
				<p>
				I’m already telling you that he has become an object around here but the reason
				and way of becoming such cannot be determined as of the moment. I suggest
				reading more can help you figure it out for yourself.
				</p>
				<p>
				The second question was asking if Sammy could really be the root or not and how
				could be such a root?
				</p>
				<p>
				As what Chapter 1 was telling us from before, I already made a declaration that
				he was the main root for the Isolation Event.
				</p>
				<p>
				But the way he became the root is such a question that you yourself have to
				figure out. It may be an odd question to figure out on your own but it will also
				be an easy question to answer if your goal was to read more. The key to your
				success here is actually your goal.
				</p>
				<p>
				The third question asks if Sammy and my dad are joining forces and working
				together for the Isolation Event to take place.
				</p>
				<p>
				This is an easy question to answer. Sammy, as described by the first chapter, is
				a root. My dad, as described by the second chapter, is an object. Apparently,
				the root and the object are two very distinct adjectives, as the root has a
				heavier weight than of the object. The root basically is the main cause of the
				event as the object is indirectly the cause of the event. In short, the roots
				are the main causes while the objects are the indirect causes.
				</p>
				<p>
				Having to differentiate the root and the object, dad and Sammy are not joining
				forces to work together to cause the Isolation Event.
				</p>
				<p>
				And besides, I don’t think a parent wanted his children to be isolated.
				</p>
				<p>
				And therefore, the fourth question, which asks for the one who was isolated, has
				been answered. Finished! I was the one isolated. But the follow-up question to
				that, which asks for the events which lead to my isolation, has not been
				answered yet.
				</p>
				<p>
				That question, will not be answered up to now. It would be better if you
				continue on reading just to figure out the answers to such questions.
				</p>
				<p>
				And the final question asks if Aunt Diet or Annie would have been the causes of
				the Isolation Event itself.
				</p>
				<p>
				The real answer to that is that both Aunt Diet and Annie have been continuing to
				help me and Sammy throughout the story, which leads to the conclusion the both
				have not been causes of such event.
				</p>
				<p>
				Well, there you go! Some of those questions have already been answered!
				</p>
				<p>
				Two pages as promised. Now is the time to go back to the main plot.
				</p>
				<p>
				Crossing the street with Annie from the “Burgies and Burgees” Restaurant, we now
				face the hospital where Aunt Diet and Sammy are situated.
				</p>
				<p>
				Turn over to the next pages and find out what they were doing in the hospital.
				Were they visiting a sick friend/relative or was Sammy ill? Or was it Aunt Diet
				who’s ill?
				</p>
				<p>
				And what about Eric when I was talking to him on the phone? What project was it?
				Should I be involved in it?
				</p>
				<p>
				Are you ready to continue the plot? If so, go!

			<p><span id="chapter10" class="glyphicon glyphicon-triangle-right" onclick="show('chapter10', 'ch10');"></span> <span class="emph" style="color:#194a89; font-size:75%; vertical-align: text-top;"> CHAPTER 10: The Feelings in a Hospital </span></p>
			<div id="ch10" style="display:none; padding-left: 20px">
				<p>
				As I was saying back in Chapter 7, Annie and I were crossing the street toward
				the hospital in front of the restaurant where we just ate in.
				</p>
				<p>
				The descriptions of the hospital? The main front was huge! It had a parking lot
				entrance in front of it, where cars can enter and park their vehicles just
				beside the hospital. There is an extension car parking at the façade of the
				building. There is a walk pathway for people to walk in and out of the hospital.
				It was a small path but it is the only way to get through it without a vehicle.
				If you pass through the main way, you might be run down by a car!
				</p>
				<p>
				Anyways, Annie just went through this small pathway where we walked and hiked
				towards the very high hospital. As a matter of fact, it just had a small slope
				where we hiked up. It was a short walk actually. I’m just exaggerating. We were
				just so tired!
				</p>
				<p>
				At last, we finally reached the top. We thought the Aunt Diet would wait inside
				the vehicle, but we were wrong.
				</p>
				<p>
				So, we went to the car parking lot. To get there from the main hospital, there
				is another small route inside the hospital where you have to enter to get to the
				façade of the building, which is the parking lot. If our van is parked beside
				the building, we may just use that route then head southeast of it. But, if we
				wished for a shorter route or a route which did not require going inside the
				hospital, we may slide down the parking lot entrance then head easterly to reach
				the parking which is beside the building. If our van is in the façade of the
				building, we may just take the same route and head out to northwest.
				</p>
				<p>
				But still, we didn’t want to enter the hospital, so we’ll take the alternative
				path. And still, we were unsure if we are to wait on the hospital main entrance
				or to wait inside the vehicle, though the van keys are not with me, nor with
				Annie. We didn’t want to go through the hospital, we didn’t want any diseases.
				We might get touched, touch something or get a virus or any disease floating in
				the air. I didn’t wish to be in a hospital when I’m not sick. I guess it will be
				okay to see a hospital when I’m sick. But if I’m not, then it’s a no-no!
				</p>
				<p>
				Still unsure whether we were to wait on the main entrance or in the vehicle, we
				made a sure guess. We decided to wait near the vehicle. We head out for our
				second route. We already saw the van from beside the hospital. It was a good
				thing! The van was not in the façade of the building. Vehicles on its façade are
				often more vulnerable and more prone to diseases. It was freaky!
				</p>
				<p>
				You might ask why were we unsure where to wait. The real answer to that question
				was that it was my fault. I was ready to go. I wanted to go already. Annie feels
				the same way. So, when I called Aunt Diet, I didn’t go through the other
				details. I just went over the most important details of the next instruction,
				which is to wait for her in the hospital in front of the restaurant. Go back to
				Chapter 7. Can you check whether she said anything about where we should wait
				for her.
				</p>
				<p>
				Still, Annie and I didn’t notify her or even asked her where to wait. We were
				too lazy to get our phones and have sent her a message or call. Part of it was
				our fault, and my fault. Well, I guess Aunt Diet must be blamed for 25%, since
				she didn’t tell me or Annie where we should wait for her. Annie had 25% blame as
				well. She did not even bother to send her a message or call her on where to
				wait. And I had the most blame, 50%, because I wasn’t able to ask Aunt Diet on
				where Annie and I will wait. And on top of it, I shared the same blame with
				Annie’s fault.
				</p>
				<p>
				But still, that didn’t matter. What matters now is that we get to our correct
				destination and to know if Aunt Diet and Sammy were successful with their
				missions.
				</p>
				<p>
				Annie and I reached the vehicle. We waited there for 10 minutes to check if Aunt
				Diet will come by. But since, she didn’t, the correct answer will be that we
				must be waiting for the main entrance.
				</p>
				<p>
				I’m always good with these decisions and this is my style of making decisions.
				If there are two choices, I check one. Then if I already made a good decision,
				then that’s the correct one. If not, I’ll try the other one. It’s always a 100%
				sure that the other one will be it when the other is not the right one. It was
				just a piece of logic.
				</p>
				<p>
				It also works with three pieces of decisions. It will be best to try to a
				maximum of two first, then you will be able to figure out the best choice there
				is.
				</p>
				<p>
				This piece of logic can also be applied to four, five, or even six decisions.
				This goes the same for more than those choices.
				</p>
				<p>
				This can be applied to forks. If you are lost on your way and come across a
				fork, don’t panic. Just try them one by one until you got the right path. It’s
				that easy!
				</p>
				<p>
				Though this logic has a lot of trial and error, it will be worth it when you
				obtain the right choice.
				</p>
				<p>
				Going back, Annie and I decide to return to the hospital’s main entrance. From
				there, we waited for Aunt Diet and Sammy. We sat down on the benches. We were
				tired. Then I spoke to Annie.
				</p>
				<p>
				“Hey, Annie! What’s the name of this hospital? Is this the right place?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Apparently, it’s The Medical Hospital and I’m not sure which hospital. Aunt
				Diet said that it was just in front of the restaurant, right?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Yes, she did.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“And you spoke to her, right?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Yes.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Then, what hospital did she say?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“The one in front of the restaurant where we just ate.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Then, our problem is solved. It’s here. Let’s just wait.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“Alright.”
				</p>
				<p>
				It took a minute of silence. I passed the lull off.
				</p>
				<p>
				“How do you feel when you are in a hospital?”
				</p>
				<p>
				“I feel disgusted. I’m not used to these hospitals. Diseases and viruses and
				bacteria surround us right now and I do not like that.”
				</p>
				<p>
				“I feel the same way.”
				</p>
				<p>
				Then she turned her head toward the skies and closed her eyes. She did not reply
				to my final words as well.
				</p>
				<p>
				We were kind of hoping what would the next results be. We were anxious. I looked
				up toward the skies as well, thinking of the next events to occur.
				</p>
				<p>
				These events will be revealed in the succeeding chapters!
