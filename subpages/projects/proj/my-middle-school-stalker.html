			<br>
			I was in 7th grade (well you can imagine what I was like in 7th grade). Very thin, tall guy (and now I’m thicc! lol), very nerdy and unattractive. Got glasses for the first time. Started wearing braces. Puberty phase. And those things just growing in your face and other parts of your body like pimples, facial hair, more acnes, and those other gross stuff.  It’s one of the most cringiest moments of my life. To tell the truth, I am feeling disgusted and about to puke while writing this. But I’m hanging on. I’d like to entertain myself, and you - the reader. This is my performance. My talent, as if I’m in Got Talent shows. And again, no writing is not my talent and not for profit.

			<br><br>Ok, carrying forward. My gross, disgusting, unattractive self does not deserve to be liked by anyone. But from what the title suggests, it seems like that sounds like an incorrect statement. And you are right! But to be fair, “stalker” does not necessarily mean that the person who’s doing the stalking is into or is attracted to someone that he/she is stalking. It could also mean that the stalker would like to cause harm to the person he/she is stalking, which is bad. But in both of these scenarios, one thing is common - it’s just creepy. And in my case, it’s the former. Some girl actually liked me and stalked me and is just creepy. Also, I cannot believe that someone actually liked me for my unattractive self. And also I cannot believe that I am writing about her and my experience. Just wow.

			<br><br>Anyways, again like how I do it, I make up some fictitious name (sometimes it resembles with the actual name, sometimes it doesn’t - just depends on my current mood, but then again it’s a secret and I won’t tell you). Ok, so let’s call her Amber. She was actually a new student in our school. (Oh geez, where is this going?) So all 7th graders come to the assembly every morning before classes start, for some morning announcements and whatever (the usual). My class’ line is always beside her class’. So I haven’t really known or noticed her until after like a month after the new school year began. I actually started noticing when I noticed that there was this girl that keeps on standing beside me during the assembly that’s not in our class, and I always try standing in different positions, whether somewhere close to the front, middle or back, like she was always there and standing beside me. (Oh and I should have mentioned that I was also in that phase wherein I was moving on from my 6th grade crush who moved to another school but that’s for a future blog story). So I was noticing Amber (haven’t described her yet but basically she has that (I don’t want to say fat) but more like of a chubby physique, kinda cute, but I wasn’t really attracted and wasn’t really into her; maybe because I got creeped out?), and then it became more intense when one of her friends (her name was Krystal) was sort of pushing her to come talk to me or get my number or something. She was just giving her a nudge nudge to make a move.

			<br><br>But because that was like the stepping stone to mature phase and I didn’t have any experience with girls back then, well, things kinda didn’t go so well. One time, before morning assembly began, Krystal came up to me and asked for my phone number. Not knowing what was going on, I gave it anyway. And that was just so stupid and cringy of me. I didn’t know what the hell was going on. I didn’t know what to do. I just met Krystal for the first time too since she too was new to the school. But I did’t have any speculations that she might be on to me. She doesn’t seem to give the vibes of “I like you and can you please put your number in my phone so I could text and call you every single day?” She wasn’t weird at all and very casual. Feels like she wanted me to become her friend. And so I did.

			<br><br>So that night, obviously you know what happened? I received a message, “Hi”, with an unknown contact. Just some harmless “Hi”. I was pretty sure it was Krystal cause who else could it be? It was only her who I gave my number too. And then we started talking a bit, but I was sort of noticing something different with the messages. It feels like she was having a tone of scaredness or shyness or some happy feeling deep inside her that she gets to talk to someone that she likes. I’m starting to realize that this pattern that these messages are oozing are not from the same person I was talking to that morning. That wasn’t Krystal, it could not have been. (Btw, I did not have any idea that Krystal and Amber were really close friends that time when I gave Krystal my number; pretty sure they came from the same school though that’s why they are pretty much close). So basically, I have concluded that the other person on the line was gotta be Amber. Hundred percent. But that time, I still didn’t know that that was her name. I just ended the conversation with “Hey Krystal, I need to go to bed. Thanks for the great conversation. Good night” (or something along those lines). Then no response. I think she got shot with those words that I think it was Krystal that I was talking to and not Amber. But well, she did not even introduce herself as Amber lol. But I know for a fact that that’s Amber, for sure.

			<br><br>So now, the next day before the morning assembly. Some random girl just came up to me and asked for a selfie. I didn’t really say yes, nor say no either, but I was more ok like “uhhh… ok?” then she pulled her phone out and took a photo of me and herself. I did smile because that was my natural reaction for photo taking. And she was like just jumping for joy and whatnot. But I was confused, what why is she so happy for a selfie with me? Like I am not even a celebirty. What the hell is going on? Then I saw Krystal standing at the far corner, smiled and laughed. She then walked out and met up with Amber. And I was like, wuht??? That confirms the Amber theory the night before and that that person who asked for a selfie with me was got to be Amber.

			<br><br>Math class began and I was sitting behind one of these guys in my class, his name was Jake. So apparently, he seemed to have saw what happened earlier that morning before the assembly. Apparently, Jake and Amber went to the same school before coming to my school. And so they knew each other, and apparently Jake knows her a lot. And he was like “Oooohhhh…. You and Amber ehhh” as what he teased me. And I was like, “Uhhhh… who’s Amber?” And he was like “Oh, that girl from the assembly that you took a selfie with. You two look perfect together!” And deep inside holy sh*t. I am going to be a laughing stock at school and everyone will ship us. O_o I was dead serious inside, I am not ready for a relationship and I am just not into her. I don’t want to hurt her feelings and have some awkwardness. She can just be a friend or whatever, but that’s it. Can’t be more than that.

			<br><br>But to be honest, I don’t really know if she’s a stalker or not. I had to confirm the theory. I checked on my facebook one day and saw that she has added me up on Facebook. And I was having some second thoughts on whether or not I should accept. I mean I can add her up and just end up as friends and literally just explain to her that I am not ready for a commitment and not into relationships as a 7th grader and probably just say something that’s implied that just means I don’t really like her. So I accepted her friend request and I was thinking what to message her. I decided to first make a draft in paper of what to say (lol cause I wasn’t into tech yet that time. As I was writing my draft of what to say to her. In a few moments in time, I’m starting to get like 10-15 notifications every 20 minutes or so. I post a lot on Facebook when I was a kid, I had a ton of friends, more than half whom I don’t really know and I am not close with. Just to get some help with those old Facebook games (and I created multiple accounts too lol). So I was saying, I saw that all the notifications were coming from Amber. She was liking so many of my photos and my posts! And I’m like, wuht? Even those from past 2 years ago?? This has just gone farn enough. She has to stop. But I just don’t know what to say in order for her to stop without getting hurt. I really feel awful and guilt about myself if I make a girl cry or hurt her feelings. It feels like it’s all my fault (regardless of it is or not) and blame myself and try to think of a punishment for myself. I just let it go at the end of the day, and just took it as an L.

			<br><br>The next day, I specifically intentionally came to class late so that I would miss the assembly and not to see Amber. Then during the break she actually came to my classroom, just to see me and I hid away pretending not to see her but she just saw me and there was nothing I could do. I can’t escape but just say Hi. And then I saw on her skin in her arm, a henna tatoo with my name on it. And it was literally the creepiest thing that I have ever seen. I have never seen it and asked her if the tattoo was permanent (cause I’ve always thought that they were always were but then she told me it’s henna and is just temporary). Sigh of relief that it’s a good thing that it was not permanent and I would never be permanent in her heart (and skin). But then it’s just getting awful as it was getting worst. Jake was there again to tease us, both of us. And a face palm for me. I told her I had to use the washroom so I had to go. Spent the rest of the break there until she had to actually leave and go back to her class. She sent me a text message saying she had to get back to class and that she would like to see me again later that day. And I’m like deep inside, nope. This just doesn’t…. Nope, just nope. 

			<br><br>Now here’s the part wherein it gets a little fuzzy. This happened more than 15 years ago. So I can’t exactly remember what happened next. I cannot remember what I had done or said for Amber to back off. But from what Krystal had told me, Amber got hurt and she cried and that it was my fault. I can’t rememember how I exactly reacted and what I did and if I did go to Amber to comfort her. Cause I do have some feelings of insecurities seeing girls cry. So perhaps I did try to do something? I’m not so sure and I can’t remember. But Amber and I didn’t stay close and we didn’t become friends after that. We just litterally stayed distant to each other. We’re no longer Facebook friends, I can’t remember if she unfriended me or I did? And we are definitely no longer texting. I deleted her number in my phone (or just lost all my contacts when I changed phones and didn’t ask for hers back), and pretty sure my contact was no longer in her phone anymore either. To be honest I forgot her last name already. Amber left and moved to another school after 1 or 1.5 years. She didn’t finish her next year in our school. She had to move, cause I think she also had to move to another region or country I think? Krystal didn’t finish her school either. Jake got to graduate but stopped teasing me after Amber had left. Pretty much it was only those two that have mentioned Amber to me. And no one else, so I shouldn’t be really be worried about being a laughing stock about Amber.

			<br><br>So yeah, that’s the story about my middle school stalker. Now that I’m grown up and looking back at all those memories, I should have not rejected Amber and instead really befriended her and maybe that’s just her personality. To be honest, I’m starting to think it isn’t all that bad that someone actually did like me during my horrible gross disgusting days. But oh well, those were the dark ages. I just had no rationale for relationships back then. But now, let’s see if I actually have that. Until my next story!
