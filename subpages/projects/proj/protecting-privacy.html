			The world today is crazy! Making connections with the current CoViD-19 Pandemic, our lives have truly changed. Most places like stores and non-essential shops are closed and placed on lockdown. As all of us continue to practice social distancing, physical isolation and self-quarantine during these challenging times in order to help prevent the spread of the virus and to "flatten the curve", we have all turned to alternative ways in living our normal lives. Essential stores such as grocery stores, pharmacies, hospitals and health factories have reduced their hours of operation. Schools have closed down; and as a result, have resorted into online or e-learning schools. Some have continued working, but from home. In these tough times, the web and the internet have been great tools that have helped us to communicate and carry messages. However, one question remains. How safe is it? I have an aunt that had always trouble with technology and I have always been there to help, as she also believes that technology also has dreadful effects. For instance, she claims that someone behind the camera of her phone is always watching her and her every move. It is not too crazy to think that it is possible. However, the question is that what are some preventive measures to practice in order to ensure that us individuals can always stay safe and keep our privacy sacred while online?

			<br><br>One obvious thing is that one must never post, upload or share any type of private information. Personal information about one's self such as age (birthyear and maybe birthdate as well) should never be shared publicly, unless you guarantee that you are sharing this to someone you completely trust. Someone you trust could be a family member, a relative or an extremely close friend that would never would want to cause harm by leaking your private information. In fact your personal and family information and photos and videos are also part of this. Remember that uploading that photo, whatever it may be, is risky and it can be used against you once it falls into the wrong hands. Uploading that means that you are signing and you approving of Facebook's or any other social media's terms and conditions. Once uploaded cannot be taken down, at least on a figurative level.

			<br><br>Furthermore, even if we publicize some of our personal information such as name, age, gender, family members, among others, Facebook (or any other social media platform for that matter) have settings wherein you can change in such a way that you can ensure that only a select few can view these information. In fact, you can "block" certain people from accessing these. However, the best way to stay safe and keep the privacy is still not to post these private information at all initially.

			<br><br>Bank and financial information such as social security information, bank account numbers among others should definitely never shared. Passwords and passcodes too should be kept privately. It may be hard to have multiple passwords for different accounts as it becomes problematic to have too many to remember. Also ensure that you create a meaningful password to you; however it shouldn't easily be guessable either (such as birthday). Having one central password for all the accounts is good in a sense that you cannot easily forget; however, can be vulnerable especially when one account gets hacked, which may affect all other accounts. Perhaps keeping a handful of secure, meaningful passwords that is only located in a safe place that only you know its location is highly recommended. 

			<br><br>One can never be transparent. For instance, picture a scenario during our time of quarantine today - you have to work from home and you have a meeting with your workmates from work. You may need to turn your web cam on in order to easily communicate in the meeting room. Platforms such as Skype, Zoom and WebEx all have these features where you can meet as a group and have a webcam and mic on. Question is, is this still safe? Is there someone else that can access your meeting rooms? How can privacy be ensured? Whether you are on a PC or a laptop, only turn on the webcam if it is needed. Be in a room in your house wherein you are alone; you are the only one privately there. Make sure nothing too flashy is in your background during the meeting. We would not want the others in the meeting room to be distracted. Sometimes a plain white wall or a green background works the best due to its simplicity. In Zoom for example, one can turn the background into a virtual background  - so that only the person in the camera be seen (all the rest are changed into a virtual background of any image opted by the user). After the meeting, ensure that the camera is off to protect the privacy. Laptops usually have laptop webcam covers that you can use to cover up the webcam when not in sure, to ensure extra privacy when it comes to using the webcam.

			<br><br>It is not too uncommon that one may need to do research work and some googling in one's school assignments. However, Google does not seem to flag all suspicious websites. There may still be one website or two in the search results that have been known to be malicious, containing viruses or perhaps a hacker that could attack you at any moment. It is always the best practical measure to select and click on sites and search results that you know are guaranteed to be popularly safe. Usually, Google is able to recognize this well and indicates a green checkmark beside the result.

			<br><br>In the online world, there are many who have always desired to cause harm to others. In that sense, we always have to practice online privacy measures that would keep us safe, not just for our own sake, but for others as well.
