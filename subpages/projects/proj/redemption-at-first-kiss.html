			As for any storytime, I will always be using fake names - just so that whoever is involved and is actually reading this would not suspect that I am talking about him/her. But I always make the fake name closer to the actual name, so that this can help to be less confused whenever I do my story telling. So for example, if the original name was something like Josh, then I replace it with John. If the actual was Elsa, I could change to something like Ellen. But for my story today, I talk about a girl named Allie and my first kiss experience with her. 

			<br><br> So Allie and I actually began as friends. We didn't meet in a fateful encounter or in an online dating app (I would actually tell stories about online dating in the future). The first time I met her is in one of my courses in my first year of university at York. I was 20 back then. And yes, a little late bloomer; takes this long before I get a bite out of my first smooch, and a little too old for starting out university this late. But hey, when you're in Canada age doesn't really matter when it comes to education. But as to why it took me this long before I can begin university is for another future story.

			<br><br> Anyways, let me first describe Allie. She's young, like around 2 years younger than me. She has a blond, curly hair, and white, fair skin. Has a short stature, a bit geeky with glasses and just plain weird. I'll explain this weirdness in a sec, but I would not prefer mentioning background even if we're in Toronto with a diverse culture and we celebrate multi-culturalism and diversity. It's just I am not comfortable doing that in any of my stories. Anyway, I'm sorry if I keep on getting sidetracked with these things, but they have to be said so that I would not be saying them over and over again in my future stories. So I've described a little bit about Allie's physical appearance. Now let's talk about her "weirdness" for a moment here. It's weirdness in a sense of childishness I suppose. It's rather annoying actually the first time I met her, to which I still considered her as simply one of my colleagues - but then it's a different perspective now. She would always come to class bringing luggage instead of a regular backpack or handbag of things, which I do not understand as to why someone would bring this so much stuff to a class of 90 minutes. Like I would literally survive with simply a notebook or a piece of paper actually and a pen, not even a pencil-user back then. Like I write my tests in pen, which I didn't even think about that time that I should use pencil so I can easily erase my work. Anyhow, I think Allie's luggage is just full of books! Like in a sense that she has like 5 or 6 classes in that single day! But I don't think you would have to bring your big, heavy textbook to class. Living in a CompSci world, we would always use digital ebooks and PDF file versions of books as much as possible - to save up some $$$ and to avoid bringing and carrying them around that would be burdensome - cause living in this digital age meant that portability is luxury. So her bag on wheels is just one of those reasons that I think she's weird in her own way; but the more I look back and think about it, there are actually other people who do this even if they're not on their way to the airport!

			<br><br> So let us step back for a second here. What else can I say about Allie that makes me think like that? So in our class, there's just about 150 of us sitting in the lecture hall. The professor, his name is Grey, like Professor Grey. He's a cool, chill guy. He's one of the reasons I got an awesome 'possum final mark for the discrete Math course. This is actually the course I am talking about of where I got to meet Allie. I find this course really interesting but it seems like most content I already know, being the Math geek I am. There's some people in the course that are just there just because the course is listed as mandatory for graduation or a prerequisite to a higher course. And they're the type of people sitting at the back. And those dumbos. You know who they are. Like no clue in the world what they are doing and why they are there. Allie, doesn't seem to fit in any one of the categories mentioned. She always sits in front and always raises her hand and keeps on asking questions to Prof. Grey (or actually to any other professor). But in all honesty, one would think that her questions were an indication of curiosity. But her questions were just plain stupid and a lot were plain obvious. It pisses a lot of the students from the class as what I see and feel because although they were directly related to the content of the material, the questions were just plain annoying and curiosity isn't seem to be oozing out but just shows how unprepared she is for university and for the courses that she is taking. It's slowing down the class a lot and even Prof. Grey seems to lose his patience and sanity. But thank God for Prof. Grey that he was able to survive and handled properly. Did I lose my sh*t? Of course. Lol. But then I guess looking it back from now, I just couldn't really believe that I was not patient and understanding of her situation. And most of all, as she struggled in the course with those dumb, not-so-smart questions, why did I not help her? No one was helping her because it was clear that she did not have friends in the course, or perhaps no friends at all - but just colleagues...

			<br><br> One day in class, Prof. Grey asked us to hand in our first assignment in his dropbox located in the Engineering building. But Allie does not know where that is and even had herself embarrassed again in front of the class as she asked the professor where his dropbox is and where the Engineering building is. It's not a stupid question to be honest since you're first year, new to the campus and submitting an assignment for the first time. I get it. But we all had this campus tours and we're given so much free time to explore and check places out. And also provided the campus map to navigate our way. It just proves that she is unreliable, or rather relies on people a lot! Stuck in the mud, I volunteered to help out and help her find Prof. Grey's dropbox in the Engineering building. We talked a bit, along the way. But nothing more than school and studies and whatever. Nothing like getting to know or no one's asking out anything. I saw as a colleague only and she also thinks the same. Trust me, I've only scratched the surface of my story. One part is getting to know Allie and her personality on a high-level. The second part here is getting to know her more in-depth. And finally the plot that actually triggered the kiss. 

			<br><br> That was first year, first semester. Not another interaction between us throughout the semester 'cause she's not really a priority, romance isn't. It's school. Second semester, not really since we were at different classes and all that. So next semester, summer semester came in. For any computer science and engineering student, one would think of taking summer courses in order to reduce the huge amount of course load over the regular semester period. So I decided to take a course called 'Mathematical Logic for Computer Science', which was offered during the summer term, mandatory as requirement for graduation and prequisite for a higher course, and had a great prof named Prof. Natalie. I liked Prof. Natalie by the way, in fact I had her for another course in that same summer semester called 'Mathematical Proofs'. She teaches very well and helps students a lot. I aced both courses all because of her, godsend as they call it! Anyway, going back, so I took a logic course with Prof. Natalie, and guess who else is in that course - you guessed it, it's Allie! Ok, so remember how I talked about the weird Allie back from Discrete Math with Prof. Grey, well she's not that Allie anymore! I mean wtf just happened?? She's no longer carrying her luggage, just a small computer bag, and then is no longer annoying with her questions. I started noticing her when she started hanging out with my guy friends (for another story but let's call them friends for now). She's in fact really smart and can do logic proofs really well. I can't believe my eyes! I can't believe what I'm seeing. The Allie that I knew before somehow got converted. Like which church did she get converted in? Lol. Or what if there were two instances of Allie? One was the original and the other was a doppleganger? Which one is the true one? Or could this be the work of futuristic aliens or robots? Damn, whatever came into my mind that day, man I'm laughing at myself right now. Lol.

			<br><br> So Allie started hanging out with me and my friends, but because of how hard Logic is, we decided to all have group study sessions altogether in the Engineering building. It was great hanging out with the guys while studying. It was great to actually talk and study with Allie. I can't believe I judged her before, I feel really bad of myself. I easily got close with her since I'm better at making friends with girls than guys. The only reason I have so much guy friends than girls is because CompSci is a sausagefest field. So there's more guys, and in order to survive uni meant that I have to make many friends as much as possible, even if you hate the person, so colleague right? You need to earn their trust and you need to trust them. So going back, Allie and I became really close and we got to know each other. She likes sushi and bubble tea. We always go out for sushi or bubble tea after study sessions. Or sometimes we would hangout and play board games with the guys. She has been so nice to me that I think I was starting to like her, not just a friend but more than that! It was so quick! We talked a lot about life, personal life. It was great meeting her, talking to her, spending time with her. We would always go hang out with the other guys. It was fantastic. And hey, back then I didn't have my driving license yet, and she would actually volunteer to drive me home every single night after school had ended. I feel so lucky to have her. I was wanting to tell her that I like her so much. But I can't tell that to my crush, I mean it's so hard to. It's either it goes well and you can step it up with the relationship when she finds out she feels the same. OR she doesn't feel the same and it could destroy a good friendship. So holy sh*t, I don't know what to do but I just gotta find the perfect time to do so. Seeing that she's single, and that no one else seems to be trying to hit up on her meaning no one seems to be interested. But I also thought what if she's not ready for a relationship or is not ready for a commitement? Also, I was thinking I will have to take the plunge, before feelings dwindle away. I'm really confused!

			<br><br> One day, Allie brought me home as usual. By the way, we live relatively closeby and my place is along the way of hers so that's why it was fine for her to drop me off. And at first I was too shy about it, but since we both enjoy each other's company, we became more comfortable of each other. And she enjoys doing what she's doing for me. On the other hand, I feel good about it because I was spending time with her! :D So on this day, Novemeber 21, 2017 - I can still remember this date on the top of my head, we were already second year at this time, Fall term. She drove me home, but we were still in her car. Like in front of the apartment's lobby. We were still talking and the topic of relationships just came up out of the blue. Holy f*ck, I became nervous and sweaty. What the heck are we gonna be talking about?? I would not be going into the full detail of what exact things were talked about, I do plan a Part 2 about Allie. But the first kiss part is more important. So my first kiss with her was so awkward and cringy. Hahahaha. Ok, so I asked her, 'Have you kissed anybody before?' And she said, 'Yeah, Louie. Once in the cheek, then another time just a peck - but no feelings'. And I was like in my head, 'Hmmm.... If I ask her to kiss me, and if she liked it even though haven't done it before, I would find out that I'm a good natural kisser and I can also get her to date me. Two birds killed in one stone!' Allie asked me, 'Have you kissed someone before?' And I was like, 'Uhhh... yeah my parents'. And she laughed so hard and loudly, 'Hahahaha', but I couldn't deep inside since it's embarrassing. I was trying to laugh with 'Ha' several times separated with some spacing. And she was like, 'Let me guess, you wanted to try?' And deep inside I was like definitely yeah! First kiss with my crush is when the love gods just decided to grant me a genie's wish without fooling me of course! So we wet our lips with water, we moved slightly forward closer and closer, she closed her eyes, I did the same cause she did it and that's why I see actors are doing in the movies, our lips touched and I pressed mine to hers. We were like that for 10 seconds, and she was like, 'Uhhh.... Gian what are you doing?' And I was like deep inside, 'Holy f*ck. I blew it'. I jumped, 'Oh my god, I'm so sorry I messed up!' (That's apologetic me) And she was like, 'Its ok. We'll do it again and I'm pretty sure you can do it!' she said as she giggled. She took me to the back of the garage of the apartment and that's where the magic happened! I, all of a sudden, started making out with her and I didn't know what I was doing at first then got my second shot of redemption to prove that I am actually a natural kisser. She liked my kisses. And I loved hers much more! I didn't describe the details of the makeout the second time around. You can figure it out. But all I can say is thank the love gods for pulling it off! The first time was a flop, but second chances are just what I needed. It felt really amazing!

			<br><br> I guess you can figure that if there was a Part 2 to this story, then there is and I will write it in the next few weeks. She would still continue to drop me off and then we would make out! Such heavenly feeling! I'll talk more about it next time. For now, I'll have to conclude today's blog post. Thank you for taking the time to read my so-called unprofessional blog and if you have reached this point without getting a headache or closing the window, you're a great person. Leaving a message below, or sending me an email means so much too! =)
