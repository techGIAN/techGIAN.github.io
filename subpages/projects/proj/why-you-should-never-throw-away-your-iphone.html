			Boxing Day - one of the most awaited holidays of the year in Canada. It’s bigger than the Black Friday that you know in the U.S. (but we celebrate it too in Canada). You get so many deals here and there, discounts are out of this world, sales are massive! Visit any retail store and people are literally fighting each other for some old-looking T-shirt. I’ve seen videos all over social media that these kinds of things are brutal and people are more ruthless in the U.S. come their Black Friday Sales. At least it’s not that situation here in Canada; I heard people here are nice. Anyways, yeah Boxing Day is always a day after Christmas (December 26 if you don’t celebrate Christmas). But it’s a good thing it’s not a one day only event. It’s usually weeklong. Some stores begin their sales a week early; some even extend until the New Year’s. 

			<br><br> So I didn’t write this blog to talk about Boxing Day and sales. I recently got my new iPhone last Boxing Day, and yes it’s the new iPhone 11 Pro model spoiler alert. I was super excited about my new phone... but one thing I have in mind as soon as I get my new phone is what to do with my old one? It was also a question asked to me by one of the sales associates from the Apple store when I was purchasing the sweet product. I know Apple has this “Save Earth by donating Old iPhones and We’ll Recycle It For You” Program. It doesn’t really resonate what good it can give, aside from saving Mother Nature, but to me of course. They also have a trade-in where I bring my old phone and they replace it with a new one but of lesser price. Is it really worth it though?

			<br><br> The question is… <i>should you really throw away your old iPhone?</i>

			<br><br> The title is a bit misleading, perhaps to the reader. Like obviously you would not throw an iPhone, you would not throw away your iPhone, which is your current phone. But what I am talking about is your old one. So you come to the Apple store, seeking to upgrade your old iPhone 5 (or 3, lol) to the new model (last year it was the 11, there are leaks that 12 is about to be released real soon!). Answer is… there’s no correct answer. It all just depends on the person’s preference. But if you were me, I would keep my old phones. But for what? They serve as trash now lying around. Hmmm… not quite. I see these old phones as emergency-purpose phones. I see these old phones as emergency phones in a way that if you lose your new current phone now (hope not), then you can still use your old phone and simply add in a sim card to it. Note that your carrier can always replace your sim whenever you lose it or the phone (some carriers do charge though!). So if you do happen to lose your phone and you do not have a replacement, tough luck. You will have to either buy a new one - which is expensive. Or perhaps buy a second-hand phone? But you would not want to risk it (especiailly me; it’s hard to have in possession of another item that could busted or have a short-life; there’s a risk factor). Or perhaps buy the “cheap” no-name model. Wait, wuht?

			<br><br> Changing the topic up a bit. Have you ever had a pet, that you’re really attached too, and then just died? Woah, we got dark here. But just hear me out. I once had a pet dog and I have been really close with this little fella, and I became sad, depressed after I found out his death. I was really close to this dog and I shared many memories with him. Only to find out I lost him. Same principle goes with a loved one, correct? Transitioning to a new iPhone has a similar flavor. Whenever you let go of an old phone and get your hands on a new one, you wish to cherish the memories you had shared with the old one. So I think it’s better to keep your old phone, as a souvenir perhaps. And if you are saying that my analogy is wrong and that I should just make an analogy on relationships - letting go and moving on to another person, well, I wouldn’t say so. You do not just get out of a relationship to hop onto a new one - because that’s literally bad. You literally have to be “off-relationship” for months at least before going into a new one. And that’s not us in terms of phones. We stop using our old phones, then right away get a new one. So there’s no “off-relationship” here, no “no iPhone for a few days, weeks or months” kind of thing.

			<br><br> And finally, it’s just not worth it! It’s not worth your money! Apple’s deals on these is not worth it at all. I remember one time asking Apple how much my old iPhone 5s was worth after 7 years in my possession - which I got brand new in 2014, and scratches and dirt are to a minimal. And you know what one of the sales associates told me - $42. Like wuht??? So if I want to trade in my old iPhone for a newer phone, then I would still have to pay $(x-42), where $x is the cost of the phone??? This is literally a no deal for me and opted to keep my phone. Literally, once that new phone lands on the palm of your hands, its overall value just drops! But what I was wondering if this was just a marketing strategy by Apple? Was it a tactic that they do? But to what end? Or was it more to it than just money? Do you think it’s possible that Apple is doing this for us to feel bad about our phones by being old? Every year, Apple tends to release a new model of the iPhone - and we somehow feel like gettting pushed to move with technology and whatever’s just trending. It’s making us get the newest and latest models. But could it be that whatever I’ve thought has something to do with this? Apparently, there are a lot of questions in mind and some answers, theories and speculations.

			<br><br> I have not mentioned anything yet, but it would most likely be that I plan on writing some conspiracy theories (both my own and others) and just writing about them. Also, conspiracy theories are entertaining for me, so that’s what I have in mind. For now, I’m signing off.
